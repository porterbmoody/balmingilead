# Book of Mormon verse
2 Nephi 29
3 And because my words shall hiss forth—many of the Gentiles shall say: A Bible! A Bible! We have got a Bible, and there cannot be any more Bible.

Here is a prophecy from the Book of Mormon that the Lord's words will "hiss forth" in our day and many people will say we have a Bible, so we have enough. We already have the Bible, why do we need anything more? This prophecy is clearly coming to pass before our eyes when many voices shout that we already have the Bible, so why do we need the Book of Mormon? 

The combination of the Book of Mormon and the JST of the Bible and other revelations by Joseph Smith result in a large sum of truths and doctrines that have either been added to the Bible or corrected errors in the Bible that occured as the Bible was mis translated over the course of hundreds of years. Many important truths related to salvation were lost and then restored in clarity and boldness through Joseph Smith. 

Prophet Joseph Smith said in 1832, “From sundry revelations which have been received, it was apparent that many important points touching the salvation of man, had been taken from the Bible, or lost before it was compiled. I believe the Bible as it read when it came from the pen of the original writers. Ignorant translators, careless transcribers, or designing and corrupt priests have committed many errors”

Bart Ehrman, an Associate Professor of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina wrote, that there are 5,366 copies of the original New Testament texts that have survived over time. With the exception of the smallest fragments, no two of these copies are exactly alike. The number of differences must be in the hundreds of thousands. Scribes sometimes even changed them to align better with their own theology.
