If you answered yes to 1 or more of these questions, this is the post for you.



## The Doctrine of Christ

When shortly after Jesus was resurrected, He visited the Nephites in North America. While teaching the doctrine of Christ, one commandment He reiterated was, 

> 27 Behold, it is written by them of old time, that thou shalt not commit adultery;
> 
> [3 Nephi 12:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12?lang=eng&id=27#p27)

He then expounded on the commandment saying, 

> 28 But I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman, to lust after her, hath committed adultery already in his heart.
> 
> [3 Nephi 12:28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12?lang=eng&id=28#p28)


## The Solution

Although there practical things that surely help and decrease frequency of mistakes, the only remedy that will have a lasting impact is the grace of Christ. Ether reminds us that His grace is sufficient for all men who humble themselves before Him. 

> 27 And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.
> 
> [Ether 12:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=27#p27)

This means if we humble ourselves before God and have faith in Him, all of our weaknesses including pornography will be turned into strengths.


I don't want this article to sound condemning. After all, Elder Nelson taught


> When comparing one’s personal performance with the supreme standard of the Lord’s expectation, the reality of imperfection can at times be depressing. My heart goes out to conscientious Saints who, because of their shortcomings, allow feelings of depression to rob them of happiness in life. 
> 
> We all need to remember: men are that they might have joy—not guilt trips!
> 
> [Perfection Pending](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1995/10/perfection-pending?lang=eng)
> 
> Elder Russell M. Nelson

And Elder Richard G. Scott taught wonderfully, 

> "[The Lord sees weaknesses differently than He does rebellion. … When the Lord speaks of weaknesses, it is always with mercy.](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2013/10/personal-strength-through-the-atonement-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng)"

## Am I still worthy?

Here's a great quote from the talk from Brad Wilcox talk, "[Worthiness is not Flawlessness](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2021/10/35wilcox?lang=eng)"


> Considering how long Damon had struggled, it was unhelpful and unrealistic for parents and leaders assisting him to say “never again” too quickly or to arbitrarily set some standard of abstinence to be considered “worthy.” Instead, they started with small, reachable goals. They got rid of the all-or-nothing expectations and focused on incremental growth, which allowed Damon to build on a series of successes instead of failures. He, like the enslaved people of Limhi, learned he could “prosper by degrees.”

This quote tells us as long as we're honest with priesthood leaders and striving to be worthy in our thoughts and actions as the temple recommend question says, we can be worthy to partake of gospel ordinances. If you are unsure if you're worthy, your priesthood leader can help you discern based on your individual situation.

Another excellent quote from Elder Uchtdorf,

> “He is not waiting to love you until you have overcome your weaknesses and bad habits. He loves you today with a full understanding of your struggles. … He knows of your sufferings. He knows of your remorse for the times you have fallen short or failed. And still He loves you”

## Hope

![jes](/images/posts/blur.webp)

Nephi reminds us of the commandment to have a [perfect brightness of hope](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31?lang=eng&id=20#p20) and Elder Holland exorts us brilliantly to,

> “Believe in miracles. I have seen so many. They came when every indication would say that Hope was lost. Hope is never lost!”
> 
> Jeffrey R. Holland
