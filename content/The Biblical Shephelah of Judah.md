The Biblical Shephelah of Judah* A. F. RAINEY Institute of Archaeology Tel Aviv University Ramat Aviv, Israel The ensuing discussion pertains to the history of the region known as the Shephelah during the so- called "Biblical Period." This period will be defined here as the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age, i.e., the Late Canaanite and the Israelite periods. Reference to later times, particularly to sources for the historical geography of the region under dis- cussion, will also be mandatory. The approach taken is that of Albrecht Alt (1925b: 2; 1953: I, 90; 1966: 136), viz., territorial Geschichte, the study of a region as a geographical unit as it appears in the ancient sources. Each place name will be treated in accordance with its significance in the particular context. Every site may have as many as three or four possible names: the biblical, the Greco-Roman or Talmudic, the Arabic, or the new Hebrew name assigned by the Israel Place Names Committee. The spelling conventions established by Aharoni (1979: 529ff.) and Avi-Yonah (1977: 225ff.) will be adhered to. At different points in the following pages, a site will be referred to by its name in the ancient sources, or in the Arabic toponymy, or in the Modern Hebrew form-in accordance with the official maps of the Israel Department of Survey- as the occasion demands. Archaeological sites may be called by their Hebrew or their Arabic name, whichever is more familiar in the professional and popular literature. Consistency is neither possible nor desirable. The Territory Name When referring to the area in question, the
Hebrew Bible always speaks of "The Shephelah," with the definite article. Obviously, it means "low-
land," being the feminine stative from the root s-p- 1. The LXX renders it by i ni68tvo;, "that which is on the plain," or by T6 i?e6tov, "the plain," but sometimes accepts it as a proper noun, Ec(prXk. Symmachus translated it nis6tvr, i.e. "lowland,"
while Aquila called it KotIXE, "valley" ( = biqcah). The expression was applied to a lower zone by
those dwelling on the Judean Hills above and to the east of the area in question. The term is used
for a similar zone in the territory between Tyre on the coast and the hills of Upper Galilee (Josh 11:2, 16b; Finklestein 1981). Otherwise, it always per- tains to the lowland of the tribe of Judah. The Region The Shephelah frequently appears in passages
enumerating the geographical regions that com- prise the territory of Judah (Deut 1:7-8; Josh
10:40; 11:16a; 12:8; Judg 1:9). The four principal regions are: the Negeb, the Shephelah, the Hill
Country, and the Wilderness. Precise delineation of the boundaries of the Shephelah of Judah
depends on the identification of the settlements listed in Josh 15:33-34 (vv 45-47 pertain to the
Philistine plain not actually conquered by Judah, cf. Judg 1:18-19 LXX). That chapter contains an
administrative roster of all the regions and their districts within the Judean tribal inheritance (i.e.,
the kingdom of Judah). Three districts are assigned to the Shephelah. A detailed analysis of the town
lists will be given below. Meanwhile, it will suffice to note that the reference is to the homogeneous
zone of Eocene limestone separated on the east from the Cenomanian limestone hills of Judah by a 1 ANSON F. RAINEY
long, narrow trough created by the exposure of Senonian chalk (Baly 1973: 141; Karmon 1971:
245), the "great fosse" of G. A. Smith (1931: 147). All of the identifiable towns in this trough are
assigned to the Shephelah according to Joshua 15 (e.g., Keilah, Nezib, Ashan). The boundary with
the Negeb in the south may perhaps be placed at the narrow pass formed by a break in the Eocene
ridges just north of Tel Halif (Kh. Khuweilifeh). The Eocene extension south of Tel Halif, called
Khasham el-Buteiyir, the "Tail (Promontory) of B." (now Giv'ot Lahav), probably can be reckoned
as part of the Negeb because of nearby Madman- nah (Kh. Tatrit; Kochavi .1972: 23) and Sansannah
(Kh. esh-Shamsaniyat). The northern vestiges of the Shephelah Eocene outcrop are the foothills
around Gezer and Gimzo (the northernmost town referred to in the Bible as being in the Shephelah;
2 Chr 28:18). In Rabbinic sources, the Judean Shephelah is called ep'elal haddiroSm, "the lowland of the
South" (Breita, Shivicit, 38:4), because it was attached administratively to the southern hill dis-
trict. The passage in Tosefta, Shivi'it (7:10), which
makes sepc'lal Lid the lowland of the Judean Hills, is corrected by the fuller version of Mishna,
Shivi'it 9:2, "And in Judah: the Hill, the Shephe- lah, and the Plain; and the Shephelah of Lod is as
the Shephelah of Darom" (Neaman 1971: II, 469- 71). Thus, it is clear that the Judean Shephelah as
understood by the Rabbis extended north only as far as Emmaus, because there the Shephelah of
Lod began (Yerushalmi, Shivicit 38 below). The western boundary of the Shephelah is a
matter of debate and will be discussed in detail below. At this point it can be stressed, however,
that the Bible distinguishes very clearly between the Shephelah and the Coastal Plain, the latter
being the territory of the Philistines (e.g. hop hayydm, Deut 1:7; mlsor, 2 Chr 26:10). The same
distinction holds for the Rabbinic sources ('emeq; Yerushalmi, Shivicit, 38 below). Therefore, there
is no historical basis for the modern application of the term Shephelah to "the western area of Eretz-
Israel along the Mediterranean sea coast from Nahal 'Azza in the south to the Yarkon" (Even-
Shoshan 1970: 1407). Such imprecise usage in modern times has given rise to the expression "the
internal Shephelah," e.g., in the daily weather reports. It thus creates utter confusion in the
historical geography of Israel and should be aban- doned by modern geographers. Though the Shephelah was morphologically a
north-south line of hills, forming a buttress for the Judean Hill Country behind it, the geopolitical importance of this area was enhanced by the several valleys, or wadis, that traverse it from east to west giving entree to the higher terrain from the
coast. The principal sources of water throughout
the Shephelah were naturally located in these
valleys, and this factor attracted the main settle-
ments in antiquity. From north to south we must mention especially: (1) the Valley of Aiyalon (Josh 10:12), the W&dT Selman, which broadens out to become the Merj Ibn Umeir-it led to the "ascent of Beth-horon" (Josh 10:10) or "the descent of Beth-horon" (Josh 10:11), the easiest approach route to the central range; (2) the Vale of Soreq (Judg 16:4), i.e., the Wadi es-Sarar, the lower extension of the deep winding ravine (Wadi Isma';n) that drains the valley of Rephaim south- west of Jerusalem (Josh 15:8; 1 Chr 11:15; 14:9; 2 Sam 23:12-13; Isa 17:5), el-Buqei'ah or Baq'ah, also called the Wadi el-Werd at the western end; (3) the Vale of Elah (1 Sam 17:2), the Wadi es- Sunt; (4) the Valley of Zephatha (2 Chr 14:9), the Wadi el-Afranj, today Nabal Guvrin; and (5) the wadi flowing past ancient Lachish and reaching the sea north of Ashdod, now called Nahal Lakhish, but formerly the WadT Qubeibeh-Nahr Suqreir; and (6) the WadT el-Hesi, today called Nahal Adorayim, and, further west, Nahal Shiqma. The latter two are not mentioned in the ancient sources. Any study of the Shephelah must utilize the information in the Onomasticon of Eusebius (Beyer
193 lb). Eusebius defines the Shephelah of his day
as "all of the lowland around Eleutheropolis (i.e.,
Bet Guvrin, Beit Jibrin) to the north and the west"
(Onom. 162: 7-9). Throughout his work, Eusebius
gives the direction and mileage for settlements in
the area from Eleutheropolis. It can easily be demonstrated that he is using some sort of road map and that his distances refer to the turnoff to
the site from a main road of the Roman-Byzantine period (Rainey 1971). The towns in the biblical Shephelah were reckoned with the Daroma district in Eusebius' day. Bronze Age History
Proto-history Early Bronze Age. With the exception of Tel
'Erani (Tell esh-Sheikh Ahmed el-'AreinT, or Tell Menshiyeh, formerly Tel Gat), the Early Bronze 2 BASOR 251 BIBLICAL SHEPHELAH OF JUDAH Age has hardly been subjected to archaeological excavations in the Shephelah (Yeivin 1975). Other sites with limited results have been Gezer, Azeqah, the large settlement at Tel Yarmut (Kh. el-Yarmuk;
Miroschedji 1981; Ben-Tor 1975), Tel Halif (Seger
1980), and, of course, Tell Beit Mirsim (now Tel
Mirsham; Albright 1976: 173). The extensive urban
settlement of EB II at Tel 'Erani has been pub-
lished only in preliminary fashion; the only histori-
cal detail derived from that site was an example of
the name of Narmer, first ruler of the First Dynasty
of Egypt (Yeivin 1975: 92). To the south of Lachish,
a site called Mishlat Ma'ahaz (Kh. Maqhaz) has
been shown to be a purely Egyptian "encampment,"
probably a trading post of some sort (Amiran
1978). Most of the other sites, e.g., Yarmut, Kh. el-Qom (Dever 1978), and also Tell Beit Mirsim, seem to have been occupied mainly during EB III and EB IV, after the urban settlement at Tel 'Erani
was in ruins. Several new Early Bronze sites have been identified in the survey by Yehudah Dagan; when the material is published, it may facilitate the establishment of a settlement pattern for the area. Evidence for the EB IV or the so-called "Inter- mediate Bronze Age" (the MB I of Albright's system) consists mainly of cemeteries such as that
at Jebel Qa'aqir (Dever 1981; Gitin 1975) or at
Lachish (cf. also the Northwest Settlement; Tufnell
1977: 739-40). This seminomadic, pastoral culture
was first identified as such by Albright in his
excavations at Tell Beit Mirsim (1975: 173-74; also
Dever 1980: 52-58).
Middle Bronze Age. The reference here is to
the MB II A-C of the Albright system. Very few
settlements have actually been identified, much less
excavated. However, there are three major towns
in which Middle Bronze occupation is impressive. At the northern end of the Shephelah, although perhaps not usually reckoned with it, is Gezer, which was a heavily fortified city in MB II (Dever 1976: 435-38). Beth-shemesh also became a forti- fied city in MB II (Wright 1975: 250-51). In the center, more or less, was Lachish, surrounded by an earthen rampart of massive proportions (Tufnell 1977: 741-42). In the south, Tell Beit Mirsim was also a fortified town (Albright 1975: 174-76). Of
special interest is an open air site, possibly cultic,
near Beth-shemesh (Bahat 1975). On Nahal Shiq-
ma, in an area that may be related to the Shephe-
lah, one finds Tel Nagila (Tell en-Najileh; Amiran
and Eitan 1977: 894-96), and Tel Hasi (Tell el- HesT; Amiran and Worrell 1976: 516).
Further archaeological research will undoubtedly reveal more sites of the Middle Bronze Age, but
the absence of any reference to Shephelah towns in the scanty written sources from this period makes
it impossible to speak of this as a "historical" period. Even the Execration texts from Egypt
(Twelfth and Thirteenth Dynasties) make no men- tion of any town in the Shephelah. Number 58 in
the later group, '-q-r-y (Posener 1940: 92), is hardly to be equated with either Ekron or Eglon;
the q is not even certain, and the associated towns on the list do not justify our seeking the town in southern Judea. Late Bronze Age-the best known sites. Here we come into the light of history. The number of
known antiquity sites also increases remarkably. To the north, Gezer is a major city-state (cf. below). The LB levels at Beth-shemesh are also well represented by excavation, although the town does not appear in the written sources. Its neighbor
in the Valley of Sorek, at Tell BatashT (Tel Batash, probably biblical Timnah of the Philistines; Mazar
and Kelm 1980), has also produced an impressive LB city. Azekah (Tell Zakariyeh), Socho (Kh.
'Abbad), Adullam (Kh. esh-Sheikh Madhkur), and Keilah (Kh. Qila) line the route from the plain into
the heart of central Judea via the Vale of Elah. To the west of Azekah stands Tel Zafit (Tell es-Saff),
probably Gath of the Philistines (Rainey 1975b). Although we would not reckon it, strictly speaking,
with the Shephelah, it undoubtedly played a role in
the history of the neighboring settlements in the Shephelah proper. Late Bronze remains were found
there by the excavations at the turn of the century
(Stern 1978). The Valley of Zephath (Nahal Guv-
rin) is less well known, perhaps, but Tel Burna (Tell Burnat), possibly biblical Libnah (Rainey
1980: 198), was in existence in the Late Bronze Age. Along Nahal Lakhish there are two major
sites, Lachish and Kh. el-Qom, (possibly biblical Makkedah; Dorsey 1980), although the latter has not produced any Middle or Late Bronze Age
sherds. Along Nahal Adorayim, there is Tel 'Eton (Tell 'Aitfn), possibly biblical Eglon (Rainey 1980:
197), and farther west, where the wadi is now called Nahal Shiqma, there is Tel Hasi (Tell el-
HesT), which is identified by some as Eglon. The problem of whether Tel Hasi belongs to the She-
phelah or not will be discussed below. Another site with some LB occupation on the Nahal Shiqma,
31983 ANSON F. RAINEY
south of its junction with Nahal Adorayim, is Tel Nagila (Tell en-Najileh; Amiran and Eitan 1977:
897). Some of the sites mentioned above are, in fact, near the points where their respective wadis
cross the "trough." From north to south, one may note that the traveler entering the "trough" from
its juncture with Nahal Sorek behind Beth-shemesh would pass by the Late Bronze sites of Adullam,
Keilah, Tel 'Eton, Tell Beit Mirsim, and Tel Ualif. Until now, LB material has not been found at Kh.
el-Qom, but a surface survey has been hindered by the presence.of the modern village.
Written Sources With the exception of Gezer, no towns in the
Shephelah region seem to appear in any of the Egyptian topographical lists of the 18th, 19th, or
20th Dynasties. An emissary from Lachish (Ra-ki- Sd) is listed on a papyrus recording disbursements
from the royal residence at Memphis (Golenischeff 1913: 5; Muller 1917: 202-3). The text dates from
the 15th century B.C. and at least confirms that there were active diplomatic relations with Egypt,
obviously as a vassal to Pharaoh. The el-Amarna tablets also shed some light on the Canaanite cities
located there. The influential city-state of Gezer was the source
and the address of several el-Amarna letters (Ross 1966; Izre'el 1978). The first ruler mentioned,
Milkilu, was involved in a coalition with the ruler of Shechem, the infamous Lab'ayu, and also con-
spired with his neighbors to seize Rubbuti, a town probably to be equated with Ha-rabbah in the
Judean Hills (Josh 15:60; Aharoni's proposed loca- tion at Kh. Hamideh would place it just outside the
Hill Country and in the Shephelah; cf. Rainey 1975c). 'Abdi-kheba, ruler of Jerusalem, com-
plained bitterly about this action (EA 289:11-13; 290:5-11). One of the rulers allied against 'Abdi-
kheba, was Shuwardata, whose own city may have been located at Tel Zafit (Tell es-Saff). It is
debatable whether the name of his town appears in the el-Amarna letters (Na'aman 1979: 681-89); it
just might be the Gimti mentioned in one of 'Abdi- kheba's texts (EA 290:25-28; Aharoni 1969: 143-
44). Be that as it may, Shuwardata claimed suzer- ainty over Qila (biblical Keilah), but 'Abdi-kheba
had bribed the elders of Qila to abandon their fealty to Shuwardata and to follow him (EA
280:16-24). Shuwardata had complained to the Egyptian authorities and had received permission
to use force in reoccupying his town. This he did and then reported to that effect to Pharaoh (EA
280:9-15). Other figures associated with Gezer are the sons
of Milkilu, Ba'lu-shipti and Yapaci, who each ruled Gezer in turn after their father's demise.
These may be the same two sons who came within an inch ("finger's breadth") of losing their lives
when outlaw rebels (the Capiru) went to Aiyalon and Zorah (EA 273:16-24). That report was sent in
by a certain woman ruler whose name, written in Sumerian signs, meant "Lady of the Lions"; her
own city was Sapuma/Sabuma (EA 274:16; per- sonal collation 29.01.80), the location of which
remains a mystery (Na'aman 1979: 680, n. 33). Several letters (EA 63-65 and EA 335) have
been shown by Na'aman to have come from a certain 'Abdi-ashtarti, who was probably the suc-
cessor of Shuwardata (Na'aman 1979: 676-84). Lachish also appears several times in the el-
Amarra correspondence. The earliest known ruler was Zimredda (EA 329), who was accused of
plotting against Pharaoh's interest at the urging of his brother, Shipti-Ba'lu; the accusation was made
by a certain Papu, evidently an Egyptian official posted at Lachish (EA 333; Albright 1942). This
information comes from a tablet found in the excavations at Tel Hasi and suggests some connec
tion between that site and Lachish. However, th letter may have been waylaid at Tel Hasi on its way
to Gaza; the official addressed is obviously o superior rank to the sender, who is at Lachish. The
town in that letter, named Yarami (EA 333:10), has been equated by Albright (1942; 36, n. 30) with
biblical Jarmuth (Kh. Yarmuk). His sophisticated arguments are not very convincing, but it may tur
out that the Canaanite name Yaramu was change by the Israelites to *Yarimoth (cf. LXX Iepetiou0
IEptpo0). In any case, Zimredda passes from the scene and
is replaced by his brother, Shipti-Ba'lu (EA 330; EA 331). A broken passage from a Jerusalem letter
indicates that Zimredda was slain by "servants [who] have become outlaws ('apirui)" (EA 288:43-
44; Greenberg 1955: 48). Lachish had subsequently furnished logistic support to the 'apiru outlaws, as
had Gezer and Ashkelon (EA 287:14-16). Another letter, apparently from 'Abdi-Ashtarti (of Tell es-
Saif = later Gath of the Philistines? Na'aman 1979: 677-78), reports that Lachish had become hostile
and had seized the town of Mo'rashti (EA 335:14- 17), perhaps to be equated with biblical Moresheth-
4 BASOR 251 BIBLICAL SHEPHELAH OF JUDAH Gath (Kallai 1971: 249). Later on, a new ruler was
in charge of Lachish on the eve of an impending campaign or show of force by the Egyptians,
preparations for which had been ordered by a series of letters to vassals throughout Canaan
(Na'aman 1979: 681; cf. Reviv 1966 and Shulman 1964: 63, n. 99).
Therefore, the brief glimpse into the affairs of the Shephelah during the el-Amarna Age (14th
century B.C.) afforded by these texts reveals that there were three or four city-states in the area:
Gezer, the home of Shuwardata (Tell es-Sifi ?); Lachish; and perhaps a place called Yaramu. Other
towns, such as Qila (Keilah) and Mo'rashti, were evidently subservient to those major cities. The
rebellion against Egyptian authority reflected in most of the texts was instigated by members of the
ruling class, e.g., the brother of the king of Lachish, and after they disappeared from the scene a new set
of rulers continued to govern the city states. The capiru, "outlawvs," are to be identified with these
same rebellious political elements. They had no connection with the Hebrews, nor were they "re-
volting peasants" seeking to escape from the feudal regime of the Canaanite princes.
Early Israelite Period Instead of entering into unnecessary and unpro-
ductive discussions of patriarchal chronology, we will begin our discussion of the direct biblical
references to the Shephelah and/or settlements therein under the heading of "Early Israelite."
Nevertheless, as will become clear, we view the patriarchal narratives as reflecting only a particu-
lar aspect of the general settlement process that occurred in the hilly regions at the end of the Late
Bronze Age (late 13th century B.C.) and continued during the 12th and 11th centuries B.C. The older,
simplistic view that the destruction levels of certain
Late Bronze strata in the Shephelah,-that is, at
Tell Beit Mirsim and at Lachish-were datable
proofs for the Israelite conquest (e.g., Bright 1981:
130-33), is no longer tenable. Of course, the
presence of such destruction levels is relevant to
the problem, but the solution is now recognized as
far more complex. The biblical tradition is not
uniform; passages describing a gradual process
of penetration and symbiosis with the native
Canaanite regime (Judges 1; Genesis 38) must be
balanced against the "conquest" narratives of
Joshua (contra Wright 1946). Archaeological sur-
veys are steadily illuminating the progress of
sedentarization process, which led to the foun
of numerous village settlements in areas whe
Canaanite occupation was sparse or nonexiste
(Aharoni 1979: 239-42). The data for this pro
in the Shephelah is still known only sketchil
Current survey and excavations in the area sh
fill the gaps in our knowledge during the next f
years. But even so, the fact that most Early I
Age settlements developed into towns and vill
in Iron II, many of which were also occupied in t
Roman-Byzantine Age, will make the retrieval of
distinct Early Iron Age settlement pattern q
difficult. The traces of Early Iron occupation
have been totally obliterated in many cases
subsequent building on the site. Therefore, it
hooves us to emphasize in this section the wri
evidence with reference to the archaeological o
in cases of specific contact.
Genesis 38. The account of Judah and his
daughter-in-law Tamar gives a glimpse into th
peaceful phase of Judean settlement. Judah
depicted as enjoying a partnership with a certa
Adullamite. He also entered into a marriage wi
the daughter of a Canaanite located in Chezib.
the three sons from this union, only Shelah su
vived, and he is known as the head of the clan tha
settled in such Shephelah cities as Mareshah, Be
ashbea (unidentified), and possibly Netaim (pe
haps Kh. Nuweitic; Albright 1925: 50), but esp
cially Cozeba, which is probably the Achzib
Mic 1:14b and also the Chezib of Gen 38:5 (Dem
sky 1966; Kh. Tell el-Beida = H. Lavnin; Ellig
1934b: 123-24), and Gederah (Josh 15:36; uniden
fied). Two other towns in this narrative are Timn
and Enaim. From Adullam, Judah "went up" t
Timnah (Gen 38:12), probably Kh. et-TibbAneh
H. Tivna (Abel 1938: 481). The second, evident
the Enam of Josh 15:34, should be between Zanoah
and Jarmuth in Nabal Yarmut (WadT Bfilu
(Thompson 1978: 176). However, the fact th

the junction of the Vale of Elah with the trou
valley might also lead us to seek CEnaim/'Enam
this vicinity for the "opening (pelah) of Enaim, on
the road to Timnah" (Gen 38:14).
So the penetration of Judah, particularly th
clan of Shelah, was peacefully accomplished in t
region of the Vale of Elah.

The Danites. According to Josh 19:40-46, the
tribe of Dan was supposed to have occupied a
territory that extended along the course of the
Sorek and also around the Plain of Aiyalon.
However, Judg 1:34-35 indicates that the Danites
failed to occupy their inheritance due to pressure
from the Amorites. Har-heres may or may not be
equated with Beth-shemesh (Kallai 1954), but
Aiyalon and Shaalbim are beside the Valley of
Aiyalon. The hill country to which the sons of Dan
were confined evidently included the northern
extremity of the Judean Shephelah, that is, Eshtaol
and Zorah, as illustrated by the Sampson legends
(Judg 13:2, 25; 16:31). The Philistines occupied the
Vale of Sorek as far as Timnah (Tell el-BatishT =
Tel Batash; Aharoni 1958: 28-29), as confirmed
not only by the Sampson stories (Judg 14:1 et
passim; 16:4), but also by the later account of the
return of the ark (1 Sam 6:12). The Sorek area was
absorbed into the tribe of Judah, and Zorah and
Eshtaol were colonized by families from Kiriath-
jearim (1 Chr 2:53, 54).
Again, it must be stressed that no traditions of
conquest have arisen from the northern Shephelah.
Even Beth-shemesh appears as Judahite (1 Sam
6:12), without any explanation in the tradition.
Jarmuth, one of the Amorite allies at the battle in
Gibeon (Josh 10:3), is not mentioned as a besieged
city in the subsequent narratives, although it is
listed, as is Adullam, in the famous roster of
Joshua 12 (vv 11 and 15 respectively).
Philistine incursions. The Vale of Elah was
thoroughly Judean during the reign of Saul. It
was, nevertheless, a frequent scene of Philistine
razzias as evidenced by the encounter depicted in
1 Samuel 17. The geographical details of that nar-
rative can readily be plotted on the map (Rainey
1975b: 69*-70*, fig. 2). The sequence of place
names and the course of events are useful in
locating such towns as Azekah and Philistine
Gath. The reference to the "way of Shaaraim"
(1 Sam 17:52) also helps to locate that settlement
somewhere north or northwest of Azekah (Rainey
1975b: 70*, contra the placement on fig. 2).
Further incursions through the Valley of Elah
were conducted by the Philistines. They were raid-
ing the threshing floors of Keilah (1 Sam 23:1-5).
Joshua 10. The retreat of the Amorites after
the battle of Gibeon was "by the way of the ascent
of Beth-horon and ... as far as Azekah and as far
as Makkedah" (Josh 10:10). It has been demon-
strated (Dorsey 1980: 185, 189) that this line of
retreat can be explained in terms of the Valley of
Elah (to Azekah) and the "trough" leading south-
wards. Thus Makkedah can be located, without
contradiction, seven Roman miles to the east of
Eleutheropolis (= Bet-Guvrin; Eusebius, Onom.
126:22-25), in the district of Lachish (Josh 15:41).
It is notable that Jarmuth does not come in for
an attack in the subsequent narrative. The rest of
chapter 10 was composed of original conquest
traditions, including an etiological tale about the
cave at Makkedah, edited in such a way as to give
credit to Joshua as the leader of the conquest. Four
Shephelah towns were conquered: Makkedah
(v 28), Libnah (w 29-30), Lachish (w 31-32), and
finally Eglon (v 34-35). The identification of these
towns has been discussed recently in detail (Rainey
1980: 196-99). The most problematic is Eglon, for
which the evidence of Eusebius is weakened because
the LXX upon which he based his work had
confused Eglon with Adullam (Rainey 1982).
Although we seem to have here an artificial crea-
tion in which conquest traditions of the four cities
are intentionally woven together, the logic imposed
on the narrative ought to make some geographical
sense. Therefore, one would expect that Eglon
should be somewhere between Lachish and Hebron
rather than way out to the west at Tel Hasi where
Albright wished to locate it (cf. below).

Joshua 15 in the chronology of Judah (Aharoni
1979: 347-52), there can be no doubt that they
represent original administrative documents, pre-
sumably for tax collection, deriving from the royal
archives in Jerusalem. It was Alt (1925a) who first
discerned that the lists were organized into regions
-Negeb, Shephelah, Hill Country, and Steppe
(midbar)-within which there were some sub-
divisions; these could be delineated by the recur-
ring subtotals giving the number of towns and their
dependent settlements. The eleven subtotals thus
define eleven administrative districts. In fact, the
Negeb and the Steppe each have only one subtotal
and thus lack any internal division into districts.
The Hill Country has seven, six in the Hebrew
Bible plus another preserved only in LXX (v 59a).
The Shephelah has three districts, the second
6 BASOR 251
BIBLICAL SHEPHELAH OF JUDAH
(vv 33-36), third (v 37-41), and fourth (w 42-
44). In addition, there is a passage encompassing
the city states of Ekron, Ashdod, and Gaza (v 45-
47), but strangely omitting Ashkelon. Its lack of
any subtotal proves that it was not a part of the
original administrative list; it was added by the
compiler of the Book of Joshua (Cross and Wright
1956: 218).
The number of identifiable towns in each district
of the Shephelah is limited but sufficient to locate
the districts in relation to one another. The accom-
panying map (fig. 1) shows the Shephelah settle-
ments identified thus far, along with the boun-
daries between the districts. The northern district,
Number Two, encompasses the Sorek and Elah
Valleys, while Number Three must have included
the area from Nabal Lakhish southwards towards,
but not necessarily including, Tel ialif (Tell el-
Khuweilifeh). The middle district, Number Four,
obviously runs from the watershed south of the
Vale of Elah to the watershed north of Nabal
Lakhish. It has seemed strange to many scholars
that the districts should be listed thus: north,
south, center. In fact, some believe that the third
and fourth districts were actually aligned each on a
north-south axis, with the third on the west, the
fourth on the east (Kallai 1967: 319-25; Kallai-
Kleinmann 1955; 1958: 155-56). They were then
referred to as the Lower and Upper Shephelahs,
respectively. However, there is no basis for this
popular theory. The location of Makkedah, a town
in the third district, seven miles east of Bet-Guvrin
(cf. below), assures that the supposed Lower She-
phelah district actually extended eastward to the
"trough" valleys at the foot of the Judean Hills. A
possible reason for the present order of districts
may have been the intention of the author to attach
the Philistia passage (vv 45-47), and he wished to
add it after the Libnah district but at the end of the
Shephelah districts because he knew that Philistia
was not really part of the Shephelah (Rainey 1980:
195). In any case, the orientation of all three
districts is east-west. In each district one or more
wadis form the axes along which the principle
towns are located. Still, this does not mean that all
the towns in Joshua 15 are in the wadis, although
many of them obviously are.
District Two (Josh 15:33-36)
The northern district list may be arranged
according to a logical "itinerary" (Thompson 1978:
157-60). Most of the solid town identifications are
based on preserved biblical names or close approxi-
mations to them, on or beside suitable Iron Age
sites. Eshtaol (probably at Deir AbO QabAs above
Ishwa'; Abel 1938: 320-21) and Zorah (SarCah)
are along the Sorek Valley. Zanoah (Kh. Zanfi')
overlooks the "trough" valley (Nabal Zanoab =
WAdT en-Najil), while Jarmuth (Kh. Yarmfik) is
perched on a hill above another deep valley (Nabal
Yarmut = WadT en-NabT Bfilus). Between Zorah
and Zanoah, Ashnah may be located at Kh. WadT
cAlin (Thompson 1978: 170-74). Between Zanoah
and Jarmuth one must probably seek En-gannim,
Tappuah, and Enam ( = Enaim) among the ruined
sites along Nabal Yarmut. Thompson (1978: 175-
76) has proposed Kh. Umm edh-Dhiyfd, Kh.
Shumeila, and Kh. en-NebY Bfilus, respectively. At
least his general approach to the problem seems to
be correct, although his identifications are difficult
to prove. The sites in question show little trace of
Iron Age occupation. After Jarmuth, the list moves
to the Valley of Elah: Adullam (Kh. esh-Sheikh
Madhkfir beside Kh. 'Id el-Ma = 'Id el-Miya),
Socho (Kh. 'Abbid beside Kh. Shuweikeh) and
Azekah (Kh. Tell Zakariyeh, in view of 1 Sam
17:1). The remaining names, Shaaraim, Adithaim,
Gederah and Gederothaim (perhaps a doublet), are
probably to be sought north or northwest of
Azekah, bringing the itinerary back toward Beth-
shemesh, which has been lost from the list (Thomp-
son 1978: 152-60).
District Three (Josh 15:37-41)
The southern district is much more difficult to
interpret. It is almost totally void of biblical place
names in the Arabic toponymy. A major site like
Tell Beit Mirsim, which must belong to this dis-
trict, is still not identified (Debir is most likely at
Kh. Rabud; Kochavi 1974; Rainey 1979). One
cannot be certain if Tel Halif (Tell el-Khuweilifeh)
belongs to the Shephelah or is in the Negeb.
Toward the west, some would include Tel Hasi
(Tell el-Hesi) as a satellite of Lachish (Wright
1971; Gophna 1981: 50-51). Its closeness to Lachish
and the line of Israelite settlements along Nabal
Shiqma (Wddi el-HesT) favors such a view. On the
other hand, the terrain around Tel Hasi is substan-
tially different from the Eocene hills of the Shephe-
lah proper. A similar problem exists concerning
Tel cErani (Tell esh-Sheikh Ahmad el-'Areint =
cAraq el-Menshiyeh). It is out in the plain beyond

T -
BIBLICAL SHEPHELAH OF JUDAH
the Eocene foothills; but it is located on Nabal
Lachish. The presence of royal Judean stamps at
Tel 'Erani (Yeivin 1975: 92) and also at Tel Zafit
(Tell es-S&ff; Stern 1978: 1027) only indicates that
there was a Judean presence there during the late
8th century (cf. below); such jar handles were also
found at Gezer (Dever 1976: 431). They do not
prove that those sites belonged to the official
Judean Shephelah districts.
The certain or probable identifications in the
southern district are as follows.
Lachish. Eusebius (Onom. 120:19-22) placed
Lachish "... seven miles from Eleutheropolis to
the south traveling towards Daroma." Abel (1938:
367) noted that seven Roman miles (ca. 10 km.)
south of Beit Jibrin (on the Daroma road; cf. Roll
1976) one would come to Dawaimeh (now Amazia),
where a turnoff to the right (west) would bring one
via Wadi el-Ghafr (Nahal Lakhish) to Tell ed-
Duweir. Recently the survey team of I. Roll has
traced the course of a Roman road eastward from
Eleutheropolis and then turning southward to Tell
ed-Duweir (personal communication from I. Roll
and Y. Dagan). The distance to Tell ed-Duweir on
this road is seven Roman miles. Tell ed-Duweir
was recognized by Albright (1929: 3, n. 2) as the
most likely candidate for Lachish; the Iron Age
town excavated there bears a striking resemblance
to Lachish on Sennacherib's reliefs (Barnett 1958),
and one of the ostraca found there mentions
Lachish in such a way that the most logical infer-
ence is that the writer means the town at Tell ed-
Duweir (contra Ahlstrom 1980). On the other
hand, Alt (1931: 20-21) and Beyer (1931a: 146-49)
reject the significance of this local road to Tell ed-
Duweir; Ahlstr6m, trying to revive their arguments
(1980), claims that Eusebius would have described
Tell ed-Duweir as being on the road to the Gerar
district (Geraritiki); but in fact Eusebius never uses
the latter as a directional indicator. The district
called Daroma included the area both south and
southwest of Eleutheropolis, as Beyer was well
aware (but not Ahlstrom, who seems to have only
a cursory knowledge of the sources). The argu-
ments he adduces from Beyer (loc. cit.) had long
ago been satisfactorily refuted by Elliger (1934a:
103-17; Davies 1982). So whichever road is chosen,
the one directly to Tell ed-Duweir or the other,
main road, to Dawaimeh, a seven-mile distance for
Tell ed-Duweir can be demonstrated. The direct
distance between Tell ed-Duweir and Beit Jibrin,
4.3 Roman miles (6.5 km.), is irrelevant to the
discussion.
Migdal-gad. It was Elliger (1934b: 113) who
first proposed to locate Migdal-gad at Kh. el-
Mejdeleh (H. Migdal-gad). This is a very plausible
identification, accepted at first by Aharoni (1964:
Map 130) but later rejected when he adopted
Kallai's division of the districts (Aharoni 1974:
Map 130; for consistency it should have been
removed in the English version; cf. Aharoni and
Avi-Yonah 1977; Map 130). Its presence to the
east of Lachish is obviously incompatible with
Kallai's theory but perfectly reasonable once we
realize that the Lachish district has to extend
eastward anyway.
Makkedah. A great deal hinges on the locatio
of Makkedah. It has already been pointed o
above that Dorsey (1980) has satisfactorily har
monized the evidence of Joshua 10 with the need
to place Makkedah in the Lachish district on the
one hand, and seven Roman miles east of Eleu-
theropolis on the other (Eusebius, Onom. 126:22-
25). He noted that the Survey of Western Palestine
had already found Kh. el-Maqdum at the right
place according to Eusebius' directions. As an
appropriate archaeological site, Dorsey proposes
Kh. el-Qom for the Israelite city, just south of Kh.
el-Maqdum, which has only Roman-Byzantine
remains. Kh. el-Qom is definitely situated in the
"trough" and therefore should have belonged to
the Shephelah rather than to the Hill Country. It is
presently the best candidate for identification with
Makkedah. In any event, Eusebius' location of
Makkedah east of Eleutheropolis makes it impera-
tive that the Lachish district in Joshua 15 be
extended across to the "trough."
Eglon. It was Albright (1924b: 7-8; 1925: 8;
1942: 32-38) who first identified Eglon with Tel
Hasi (Tell el-HesT), for two reasons. First, Kh.
'Ajlan (H. Egla) was nearby. With regard to this
toponym one must note that Eusebius makes an
entirely incidental allusion to a place called AyXa,
10 Roman miles from Eleutheropolis as one goes
to Gaza (Onom. 48:18-19). He did not connect this
place with Eglon, which he knew as EykoCg (Onom.
84: 22), although he was misled about the latter by
the LXX confusion with 08oXXa. (= Adullam).
The Arabized name of AyXa can also be explained.
1983 9
ANSON F. RAINEY
At the time of the first conquest by the Arabs, under
'Amr ibn al-'As, that chief had at Beit Jibrin a domain,
called 'Ajlan, after one of his freedmen (Yakut, II, 19;
cited by Le Strange 1890: 413).
So Kh. 'Ajlan, while corresponding to the place
mentioned by Eusebius, bears the name of a former
slave of 'Amr. Besides, one might have expected
Hebrew 'Eglon to have become 'Ajlun, as else-
where in Palestinian toponymy.
Albright's other argument was that the archaeo-
logical remains at Tell el-Hesi matched the history
of Eglon. This observation loses its value when the
documentary evidence is against the proposed equa-
tion in the first place, as demonstrated by Albright's
similar argument with regard to Tell Beit Mirsim.
As for the textual indications about Eglon, Elliger
(1934b: 66-67) pointed out that placing Eglon at
Tell el-Hesi made nonsense out of the itinerary of
Josh 10:34-37; he thus proposed Tell Beit Mirsim
for Eglon, because this latter site was on a road
leading to Hebron. Noth (1953: 95), accepting the
arguments of Elliger, rightly observed that Tell
Beit Mirsim was too far south. Instead, he pro-
posed Tell 'Aitun (Tel 'Eton), which would be on a
more natural route from Lachish to Hebron via
W&ad el-Jiza'ir (Nahal Adorayim). There is no
doubt today that Tell 'Aitun has all the physical
and archaeological characteristics for biblical Eglon
(Rainey 1976a). Albright (1938: 2, n. 1) noted that
the name of this site is the singular of 'Atawineh,
preserved in a toponym near Gaza (Rasm or Rujm
el-'Atawineh = Giv'ot CEtun). He rightly states
that the -un derives from the West Semitic diminu-
tive -on. Furthermore, he was aware that Tell
'Aitun had evidently received its name from nearby
Kh. 'Aitun et-Tahta (H. 'Eton), just to the north-
west. The latter is a Roman/ Byzantine village ruin.
Such a process, whereby the late village gives its
name to an adjacent tell whose biblical name has
been lost, is common in the Shephelah, e.g., Beit
Mirsim, ed-Duweir, es-S$af (Albright 1929: 3;
Rainey 1957: 66*), the latter based on the testi-
mony of local inhabitants (Robinson 1867: II, 30).
It is not necessary, therefore, to suppose that
'Aitun reflects biblical 'etam, i.e., Etam (contra
Aharoni 1974: Map 130; Aharoni and Avi-Yonah
1977: Map 130).
District Four (Josh 15:42-44)
There has never been any doubt that this district,
the central one, extended eastward to the trough.
That is proven by the location of Keilah and Nezib
(cf. below). The main question, raised by Kallai
and others, is whether it reached westward beyond
the ridge bearing Tel Goded (Tell Judeideh). The
location of Libnah (cf. below) is a crucial point in
this issue. One thing is certain, with the fixing of
Makkedah in the "trough" at the foot of the
Judean Hill Country (cf. above): the Fourth
District was effectively blocked on the south. One
cannot, therefore, bring its boundaries down
toward the Negeb to encompass a Simeonite area
in the southern "trough" (contra Kallai 1967: 231,
n. 1; Kallai-Kleinmann 1958: 159).
Mareshah. Eusebius (Onom. 130:10) placed
Mareshah two Roman miles east of Eleutheropolis.
Just there one finds Tell Sandahannah (T. Maresha)
and its accompanying cave burials, with their
Greek inscriptions mentioning Marisa. The boun-
dary between the Lachish and Libnah districts has
to pass between Tell Sandahannah and Tell ed-
Duweir. An east-west line along the watershed
between WadT AfranjT and Wadi Qubeibeh makes
good sense. A north-south line, as proposed by
Kallai (1971: 253), Kochavi (1972: 22), and Aharoni
(1974: Map 130; Aharoni and Avi-Yonah 1977:
Map 130), has no topographical logic behind it
whatsoever. Though there is a ridge extending
from Tell Zakariyeh (Tel 'Azeqa) to Tell Judeideh
(Tel Goded), it is broken by the basin in which
Beth-guvrin (Eleutheropolis) was located and there
follows a series of rolling fields between Mareshah
and Lachish. From Tel Judeideh to Lachish there
is no topographical feature visible to the naked eye
that would suggest a district boundary separating
east from west.
Libnah. Many suggestions have been made for
the identification of Libnah (Kallai 1962). One of
the most frequent was Tell es-Saft (Wright 1966:
78); but the name of that tell means "bright,
shining" and not "white." In the Sennacherib cam-
paign, it hardly makes sense that the Assyrians
would have taken Ekron (Tel Miqne = Kh. el-
Muqanna') and then gone around to Tell es-Saff
to attack Lachish, only to return to Tell es-Safi
later (Rainey 1975b: 75*). Furthermore, it is impos-
sible to visualize an administrative district reaching
from Mareshah to Tell es-Safi.
The apostasy of Libnah during the reign of
Jehoram (2 Kgs 8:22) indicates that it was in close
proximity to Philistia (Kallai 1971: 252). Placing it
10 BASOR 251
BIBLICAL SHEPHELAH OF JUDAH
to the east, with the entire Lachish district blocking
the way, never made any sense. Furthermore, its
status as a Levitical city (Josh 21:13) also suggests
a role as border fortress facing the west (cf. Mazar
1960: 200; 1974: 227). Therefore, one seems com-
pelled to accept the arguments of Elliger (1934b:
60-63) for placing Libnah at Tell Born,t (Tel
Burna), as originally suggested by Albright (1924b:
9). Such a westerly location for Libnah is not at all
convenient for Kallai's theory, since it places the
key biblical town west of his supposed north-
south division between the Third and Fourth
Districts (Kallai-Kleinmann 1958: 155-56).
Ether. Another identification usually rejected
by scholars, for various reasons, is that of Ether
with Kh. el-'Atr (Palmer 1881: 369; Press 1948:
344; 1955: 762; Guerin 1896: II, 313, wrongly Kh.
el-Hatr; Biran 1964: 1450 wrongly Kh. el-'At.r,
today T. 'Eter). A settlement of the same name is
included among the towns of Simeon (Josh 19:7),
in the small group of towns that always stand apart
from the main Simeonite list. In 1 Chr 4:32 we
have Tochen instead of Ether, and in 1 Sam 30:30
we have Athach. The LXX of Josh 15:42 has IOaK
in B, while text A (much closer to the Hebrew) has
AO0p. Albright (1924a: 160) assumed that the pair
Ether and Ashan had been inserted erroneously
into the Shephelah list, because of the presence
there of another Ether (our Kh. el-'Atr), and that
later they had fallen from the Negeb list. Noth
(1953: 113-14) also concluded that the pair of
towns belonged in the Negeb. But it can hardly be
a coincidence that Kh. el-'Atr exists within a short
distance from the very best candidate for Libnah
(Tell Bornat), while the list in Josh 15:42 has
"Libnah and Ether," one after the other. The
Arabic CAtr is the exact linguistic reflex of the
Hebrew 'Eter. Therefore we must insist on the
authenticity of the Ether in Josh 15:42; it is another
town in the Libnah district, ca. 2 km. west of Beit
Jibrin and almost due south of Tell Bornat. The
next town in the list, Ashan, is still problematic.
Ashnah. The fact that the Old Latin version
had Idna in this passage led Abel (1938: 255) to
suggest that this was the original name. The Greek
MSS are quite confused in the renderings of the
names in these verses (i.e., vv 42-43). It would
appear that the identification of Hebrew Ashnah
with Idna lies behind Eusebius' reference to Ie6va
(Onom. 106: 15-16), six miles east of Eleuthero-
polis. The fact that the name is a doublet for
Ashnah in District Two (cf. above) suggests that
one or the other is in error. If any weight can be
given to the Latin reading, this town is to be
equated with present day Idna, which would make
for a logical sequence with the following Nezib and
Keilah. Therefore, we are inclined to accept Abel's
proposal. It is hard to accept Idna as an original
Hebrew name, however. The -d-, possibly for
original dhal, might be due to an ancient Edomite
(Idumean) form having the same shift as Aramaic.
Nezib. Both Eusebius and Jerome (Onom.
136:21 and 137:24, respectively) place this town
east of Eleutheropolis in the direction of Hebron,
but the former says nine miles while the latter says
seven miles. This points to Kh. Beit Nesib esh-
Sharqiyeh, also in the trough valley (Guerin 1869:
343-45; Kochavi 1972: 53-54).
Keilah. Eusebius says that Keilah, under the
name Krlka, was located "east of Eleutheropolis,
going to Hebron, about eight miles" (Onom.
114:16-17). His directions would lead one along
the Hebron road where, after about eight miles, he
would find a turnoff northward along the "trough"
to Kh. Qila, which preserves the ancient name. The
archaeological remains are also admirably suitable
(Kochavi 1972: 48-49). The location is also per-
fectly appropriate to the biblical and el-Amarna
references discussed above. This identification
(Guerin 1869: 341-43), against which there h
never been any scholarly objection, goes with th
of Nezib to prove that the Libnah district exten
to the "trough" valley. The absence of the con
sonant 'ayin in the Arabic name is evidently due to
the intermediate Greek form. The el-Amarna form
is ambiguous.
Population
It has already been mentioned that the northern
Shephelah district contained a Canaanite element
in the population that lived in symbiosis with
Judah. The Samson stories also confirm the pres-
ence of some clans from the tribe of Dan. The one
documented clan of Judah in the area is that of
Shelah. If our recent suggestion about the corr
interpretation of 1 Chr 4:32 can be accepted (Rain
1980: 199-200), then Simeon also had some sett
ments in the Shephelah, perhaps Ether and Ash
in the Libnah district. En-rimmon is in the northern
1983 11
ANSON F. RAINEY
Negeb (Kh. Umm er-Ramamin = H. Rimmon, at
least for the Byzantine site). Perhaps Etam and
Tochen should be sought somewhere in the Lachish
district. During the United Monarchy, Levitical
cities were established for military and admini-
strative purposes at Libnah (Josh 21:13) and Beth-
shemesh (Josh 21:16), and perhaps at either Ain
(Josh 21:16) or Ashan (1 Chr 6:59).
Therefore one can see that the population of the
Shephelah area was a mixture of Danites, Shela-
hites, Simeonites, and, of course, some Canaanites
(and/or Amorites) absorbed during the course of
the settlement process. Other Judean clans and
also Calebites and Kenizzites may have settled
there as well, but documentation is lacking.
The Monarchy, Historical
It remains to review briefly the historical events
in which the Shephelah played a role. The order
will be chronological, and only details shedding
light on the geopolitical importance of the Shephe-
lah will be stressed. The chronology followed in
this section is that of Thiele (1965), which is the
only convincing interpretation of the data. The
odds against his system being incorrect in accor-
dance with the ancient documents are astronomical.
The fact that it works and produces a marvelous
historical picture is further proof of its authen-
ticity. The attempt to break the Massoretic chro-
nology by preferring Septuagint readings (Shenkel
1968) only creates chaos and solves nothing; it has
been satisfactorily refuted by Thiele (1974).
Late 10th-Early 9th Centuries B.C.
Rehoboam's Forts (2 Chr 11:6-10). Solomon's
immediate successor in Judah took steps to
strengthen his defenses, evidently quite soon after
his rise to power. Kallai (1971), following Beyer
(1931a: 129-34), argued that the list of Rehoboam's
towns represented an attempt to refortify Judah
after the disastrous attack by Shishak. The She-
phelah line of western strong points, Lachish,
Azekah, Zorah, and Aiyalon, seemed to exclude
most of Kallai's hypothetical Third District in the
even more hypothetical "Lower Shephelah." Since
his Upper and Lower Shephelah concept has been
refuted by the proper understanding of Makkedah's
position (cf. above), there is no longer any theory
to defend. But even more important, there are two
compelling reasons for placing Rehoboam's forti-
fication activity before and not after Shishak's
campaign. (1) The order of events in Chronicles is
clear; the building activities precede the campaign
of Shishak in the narrative and it is specifically
stated that Shishak "took the fortified cities of
Judah" (2 Chr 12:4), an obvious allusion to the list
of towns in the previous chapter. (2) After the
devastation and impoverishment of Shishak's
campaign, Rehoboam would have faced a bankrupt
treasury and a loss of his main source for outside
income, the control of the trade routes through the
Negeb. On the other hand, during the first three
years of his reign Rehoboam enjoyed the support
of the vast influx of Levites from the northern
kingdom (2 Chr 11:13-17). These must have
contributed materially to the military, engineering,
and logistic cadres needed to do the job.
The list of towns fortified is probably not com-
plete; its internal logic is also not clear. In fact, it
appears that the roster is made up of several
smaller groupings whose order within the list itself
may be totally haphazard. Two main groups fall
within the Shephelah. The first seems to deal with
towns along internal lines of communication, viz.,
the Vale of Elah: Socho, Adullam, Gath (unless the
suggestion to correct to [Moresheth]-gath is accep-
ted; Aharoni 1979: 330), and the Valley of Zephath:
Mareshah (and perhaps [Moresheth]-gath). The
second group, listed from south to north, forms a
line of major forts commanding the western fron-
tier of Judah: Lachish, Azekah, Zorah, Aiyalon.
As Kallai has suggested (1971: 246), Libnah and
Beth-shemesh can probably be included in this
defense system, as that was an original function of
the Levitical cities. For the problem of the third
Levitical city in the Shephelah, either Ain or
Ashan, cf. the discussion above.
It is impossible to determine whether Shishak
actually captured any cities of the Judean Shephe-
lah. At least none of the names preserved in his
inscriptions at Karnak can be equated with known
towns in the Shephelah. Kitchen has attempted to
read the name Makkedah in one place (1973: 298,
435), but the present writer has examined the
relevant entry at Karnak and finds Kitchen's pro-
posed reading unconvincing.
Asa's resurgence. After Judah had gained the
upper hand in the civil war with Israel (during the
reign of Abijah; 2 Chr 13:19-20), Judah was able
to begin rebuilding itself. This was accomplished
under the leadership of Asa (911-870 B.c.; 2 Chr
14:1-7). In Asa's 15th year, he and his armed
12 BASOR 251
BIBLICAL SHEPHELAH OF JUDAH
forces repulsed an attempted invasion by a certain
Zerah, "the Cushite" (2 Chr 14:8-14; 15:10). The
action took place "in the valley of Zephath belong-
ing to Mareshah" (v 9). the Septuagint reads KaTa
poppav MaptaoS, "to the north of Marisa," evi-
dently representing an original sap6nah leMaresah.
The pursuit of the enemy led to the plunder by the
Judeans of the Gerar region.
Under these circumstances, it is possible to
conjecture that some Shephelah towns may have
been destroyed during Shishak's campaign (926
B.C.), e.g., Beth-shemesh, but that they were rebuilt
toward the end of the 10th century by Asa. The
long peaceful reign of Asa and that of his son,
Jehoshaphat, may account for the lack of destruc-
tion levels in the 9th century strata of many Judean
sites. Lachish Stratum IV could very well be the
city built by Rehoboam and utilized by Asa and
Jehoshaphat.
Mid- and Late 9th Century B.C.
Jehoshaphat. This ruler, who seems to have
been coregent with his father during the latter's
illness (2 Chr 16:12-13; Thiele 1965: 70), began by
strengthening his internal organization (2 Chr
17:1-2, 7-9). The object of this endeavor was to
regain the confidence of the leaders and the rank-
and-file after the estrangement that had developed
between throne and people in the latter days of Asa
(2 Chr 16:10). The success of these efforts can be
seen in the new respect commanded by Judah
among its neighbors; Jehoshaphat received tribute
from the Philistines (2 Chr 17:11), as well as from
the Arabs. Thus Jehoshaphat endured no threat
from his western border; the Shephelah was safely
established. As a result of the income derived from
his foreign tribute (due to control of the Negeb and
the caravan routes from the Arabah to the Philis-
tine coast), Jehoshaphat was then able to build
further stores and fortifications (2 Chr 17:12-13).
Jehoshaphat placed his sons in charge (2 Chr 21:3)
as commanders of some of these strongholds.
Some of his fortified centers must have been in the
Shephelah, but unfortunately no list has been
preserved.
Jehoram. The son of Jehoshaphat also served
as coregent for five years (Thiele 1965: 69-70).
During the first year of his coregency, 853 B.C., the
ill-fated fleet was wrecked at Ezion-geber (during
the short reign of Ahaziah in Israel; 2 Chr 20:35-
37; 1 Kgs 22:49). The discontent that arose from
this unpopular joint venture with Israel found
expression in the prophecy of a Shephelah spokes-
man, Eliezer son of Dodayahu from Mareshah
(2 Chr 20:37). When the old king, Jehoshaphat,
died, Jehoram further weakened the royal position
by killing all of his brothers who commanded the
fortified cities (2 Chr 21:4).
Not only did Edom manage to break away from
its vassallage to Judah (2 Kgs 8:20-22; 2 Chr 21:8-
10), but Libnah also revolted (tipsa') from Judah
(2 Chr 21:10; 2 Kgs 8:22). This can probably be
taken as an indication that the entire Shephelah, or
most of it, declared its independence from Jeru-
salem. It is hardly coincidental that Jehoram set up
his cult centers (bam6t) in the "hill country of
Judah" (2 Chr 21:11). The Negeb was evidently
lost to his control, and the Shephelah was in revolt.
The final result of Jehoram's weakness was the
invasion by the Philistines and the Arabs; they
even attacked the capital in Jerusalem and slew al
the king's sons but one (2 Chr 21:16-17). It must
be remembered that Libnah and Beth-shemesh
(and perhaps Ain or Ashan) were the only Levitical
cities in the Shephelah; since the split in th
kingdom, the Levites had gained an ever mo
important role in the administration of Judah
especially under Jehoshaphat's rule (2 Chr 17:7
10). The rebellion of Libnah, therefore, can hardly
be divorced from the discontent on the part of th
Levitical cadres over Jehoram's political and re
gious policies, influenced largely by his marria
alliance with the royal house of Omri (2 Chr 21
2 Kgs 8:18). It is impossible to say how long th
Libnite rebellion continued. The high priest an
the Levitical guards brought an end to the Omr
influence in Jerusalem by the assassination
Athaliah (2 Kgs 11:4-20; 2 Chr 23:1-21).
Joash. Since it was the high priest, Jehoiada
who had installed his nephew Joash on the throne
the relations between the crown and the Levitical
establishment were now cordial. After the death of
Jehoiada, things went awry (2 Chr 24:17-22), and
the political leaders (sare yehudaih) enticed the king
to foreign worship. Was it a coincidence that a
foreign army, from Aram, was able to invade
Judah, besiege the capital and come off with a
heavy ransom (2 Kgs 12:18; 2 Chr 24:23-24)? The
route of their approach was from the west. The
army of Hazael captured Gath and then found the
way open to Jerusalem. The chances are fairly even
between two possibilities for the identification of
1983 13

this Gath. It could have been the Gittaim (2 Sam
4:3; Neh 11:33) located somewhere near modern
Ramlah (Mazar 1954; 1975: 101-9), probably iden-
tical with Gath-rimmon (Strange 1966: 122-29).
Or it could have been Philistine Gath, evidently to
be located at Tel Zafit (Tell es-Sifi; Strange 1966:
128; Rainey 1975b). If the latter, the road to
Jerusalem must have led through the northern
district of the Judean Shephelah. If it were the
more northerly Gittaim, in the Danite territory,
then Hazael's troops might have gone up via Beth-
horon or Kiriath-yearim.
First Half of the 8th Century B.C.
Amaziah. Two important events in the life of
this king took place in the Shephelah. His dispute
with Israel culminated in a confrontation at Beth-
shemesh (792 B.c.), where he was defeated by
Joash, king of Israel, and taken captive (2 Kgs
14:11-14 = 2 Chr 25:21-24). After the death of his
captor, Joash, Amaziah lived another 15 years (till
767 B.C.). His son Azariah/Uzziah had been ap-
pointed king in 792 B.C. (Thiele 1965: 81-87), so
those 15 years were evidently spent by Amaziah in
relative inactivity in Jerusalem. No specific reason
is given for the conspiracy that was initiated against
him; it could hardly have been done without the
knowledge and even the consent of Azariah. The
Chronicles account blames it on Amaziah's apos-
tasy from the Lord of Israel, which probably
implies not only religious but also political sedition.
Amaziah tried to flee for safety to another impor-
tant Shephelah city, Lachish, but his enemies had
him assassinated there (2 Kgs 14:17-21; 2 Chr 25:
25-28). If Amaziah had hoped to gain the support
of a local governor at Lachish (perhaps a member
of the royal family), he was sadly mistaken.
Azariah/ Uzziah. The Shephelah had been the
scene of Judah's humiliation at the hands of Joash,
king of Israel (cf. above), but under the new and
energetic king, Azariah/ Uzziah, it became the base
for a resurgence of Judean power. The enemy
was Philistia, and the campaign was directed
against their northern territories: Gath, Jabneh,
and Ashdod were conquered and their walls broken
down; Judean strong points were then built in the
Philistine territory (2 Chr 26:5-6). Certainly after
this Gath disappears from the traditional list of
Philistine political centers. The Gath here was
hardly Gath(-rimmon)/Gittaim (contra Strange
1966: 128). Philistine Gath may have been annexed
to Judah. The exact dates for this military action
cannot be pinpointed, except to say that it prob-
ably took place prior to the death of Amaziah
(767 B.C.); after that date, Azariah concentrated on
extending his control southward as far as Elath,
which he rebuilt (2 Kgs 14:22; 2 Chr 26:2). The
power to accomplish this feat probably derived in
large measure from the exploitation of Philistia
and the trade routes that formerly enriched the
Philistines (2 Chr 26:7).
The king had extensive land holdings in the
Shephelah, which were farmed by cultivators
('ikkarim); to these were added further holdings in
the newly conquered coastal plain (mft6r; 2 Chr
26:10; Rainey 1981).
Second Half of the 8th Century B.C.
The great successes of Azariah/Uzziah were
reversed with the appearance on the western scene
of Tiglath-pileser III.
Ahaz. Some of the western states tried to
organize a united front against the Assyrian thr
the leaders in this movement were Rezin of Damas-
cus and Pekah of Israel. The latter had been ruling
in Gilead while Menahem was ruling in Samaria
(Thiele 1965: 124). After the first campaign by
Tiglath-pileser III in the west, when Menahem
paid him tribute (743 B.C.; Thiele 1965: 111), Pekah
apparently made his alliance with Rezin and soon
had sufficient strength to seize power in Samaria
as well, assassinating Menahem's son, Pekahiah
(2 Kgs 16:25; 740/739 B.C.; Thiele 1965: 124).
Tiglath-pileser III continued to campaign in the
north and west down to 738 B.C. (Thiele 1965: 105).
While he was engaged in Media (737 B.C.) and then
in Urartu (736 B.C.), Rezin and Pekah began to
organize their anti-Assyrian alliance. In Judah,
Ahaz was appointed coregent (2 Kgs 16:1), evi-
dently with the support of the pro-Assyrian faction
in Jerusalem (Thiele 1965: 127). Since he refused to
join the league against Tiglath-pileser, his neigh-
bors attacked him on all fronts (734 B.C.): Rezin
and Pekah besieged Judah from the north and
took many prisoners (2 Kgs 16:5; 2 Chr 28:5-15);
Edom, with Aramean support, occupied Elath
(2 Kgs 16:6) and invaded Judah from the south
(2 Chr 28:17); and the Philistines also made a
thrust into the western Negeb and the northern
Shephelah (2 Chr 16:18). The towns listed in the
latter action show that the Philistines erased the
gains formerly made by Azariah/Uzziah; most of
14 BASOR 251
BIBLICAL SHEPHELAH OF JUDAH
them were in the northern Shephelah district, that
is, Beth-shemesh, Gederoth, Socho, and Timnah,
while two others, Aiyalon and Gimzo, show that
Judah had previously moved northward into the
Aiyalon Valley, at the expense of Israel. The vital
northern approaches to Jerusalem (Aiyalon, Sorek,
and Elah Valleys) were all blocked. Even though
Ahaz became a tributary to Tiglath-pileser and
sought his aid against these attacks, his position
vis-a-vis his neighbors was not improved (2 Chr
28:21). Tiglath-pileser himself soon came to make
war on the Philistines (also in 734 B.c.) and forced
them to accept Assyrian hegemony (Tadmor 1966:
88-89). One of his reliefs shows the conquest of
Gezer (Pritchard 1954: No. 369), which must have
been a Philistine stronghold at the time because it
is west of Gimzo and Aiyalon. The status of the
Shephelah remained unchanged for the next 22
years, until the reign of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah. The son of Ahaz came to power in
716/715 B.c. (Thiele 1965: 139, 150) and managed
to stay out of the Philistine embroilments with
Sargon II of Assyria. The latter's armies came to
Philistia in 720, 713, and 712 B.c. for the purpose
of quelling rebellions. In 720 B.C. Hanno of Gaza
and an Egyptian army were defeated (Tadmor
1958: 38). In 713 it was necessary to depose a ruler
of Ashdod and to replace him. In 712 a new
usurper at Ashdod was driven out; the Assyrians
took Gibbethon, Ekron, Gath, Ashdod, and
Ashdod-yam (Tadmor 1958: 83). Judah seems to
have either stood aloof or at least to have paid its
tribute in the nick of time. But with the death of
Sargon in 705 B.C., Hezekiah began a concerted
effort to rally the western states against the new
Assyrian monarch, Sennacherib. The Ekronites
deposed their pro-Assyrian monarch, Padi, and
turned him over to Hezekiah as a political prisoner
(ANET287-88). Ashkelon's ruler, Sidqia, willingly
joined the alliance (loc. cit.), but Mitinti of Ashdod
and SillT-Bel of Gaza refused. Hezekiah took spe-
cial steps against the latter; he moved in force
westward and occupied territory in the western
Negeb and in the adjacent area of Gaza (2 Kgs
18:8). Wine from the royal vineyards was dis-
tributed along with other supplies to key admini-
strative centers. Thus jars with the royal seal
impressions (Imlk) are found in abundance at
Lachish, as well as in and around Jerusalem. In the
Shephelah they are found at Gezer and Tel Zafit
(Tell es-Safi), and also at Tel 'Erani, showing that
those sites were at that time under Hezekiah's
control. Incidentally, the name Socho that appears
on many of these royal seal impressions certainly
does not refer to the Socho in the Valley of Elah,
but rather to the one in the southern Hill Country
(Josh 15:48), where the royal wineries were located
(Stern 1975: 51, n. 23; Rainey 1981).
When Sennacherib finally appeared on the scene
in 701 B.c., he began his subjection of the anti-
Assyrian league by taking Phoenicia; then he
marched down the coast to the southern Sharon
where he had to besiege four towns, Joppa, Beth-
dagon, Benei-baraq, and Azor. Once that area, i.e.,
the port of Joppa and its hinterland, was in his
hands, he was ready to launch his attack against
the Philistines and the Judean Shephelah. As
Aharoni has demonstrated, the biblical order of
events is most probably correct, even when it seems
to be contradicted by Sennacherib's annals (Aha-
roni 1979: 387-94). Another recent discovery, the
relevance of tablet fragments formerly assigned to
the campaigns of Tiglath-pileser and of Sargon
(Na'aman 1974), depicts the conquest of "Azekah
... his (Hezekiah's) stronghold, which is between
my [bo]rder and the land of Judah ... located on a
mountain ridge .. ." (Na'aman 1974: 26-27). Then
it goes on to describe the conquest of ". . . a royal
[city] of the Philistines, which H[ezek]iah had
captured and strengthened for himself..." (loc.
cit.). These details can be coordinated with the
annals to give the following picture of Sennache-
rib's invasion tactics in the Coastal Plain. After
securing Joppa and its attendant towns, the
Assyrians turned eastward; they took Timnah (Tell
Batashi), thus cutting the line of communication
between Judah and Ekron via the Sorek, and then
they mounted a major seige of Ekron (Tel Miqne
= Tell el-Muqanna'). After that, they thrust inland
once again, this time to capture Azekah and thereby
command the Vale of Elah. With Gath (Tell es-
SAff) thus isolated (the missing name in the newly
interpreted fragment; loc. cit.), they could also
attack it without threat of interference from Judah.
In each case, they seized a major site on one of the
routes through the Shephelah to the Judean Hill
Country. Sennacherib then states in his annals that
he took from Judah, "forty-six walled towns and
their numberless surrounding villages." It has been
cogently suggested that the lament over towns in
the Shephelah and western Judean hills in Micah 1
reflects this campaign (Aharoni 1979: 392-93). The
prophet makes a play on the names of several
1983 15
ANSON F. RAINEY
Judean towns, some of which are in the Shephelah
(Mic 1:10-16). These are Lachish (v 13), Achzib
(v 14), and Mareshah and Adullam (v 15), all of
which are known from Joshua 15. Za'anan (v 12)
may possibly be identical with the Zenan of Josh
15:37; and Moresheth-gath (v 14), if identical with
the Morasthi of the Byzantine sources (Eusebius
Onom. 134:10-11 and Jerome, Onom. 135:14-15;
Ep. of Paula XVIII; Prologue to Micah, PL 25,
1151; Ps. Epiphanius ed. Nestle, 24, 1; Madeba
Map, No. 90, Avi-Yonah 1954: 69), is said to have
been a village east of Eleutheropolis. Gath (v 10) is
certainly the Philistine city at Tell es-S.fif, which
was evidently under Hezekiah's control, as demon-
strated by the presence of the Imlk seal impressions
found there. The remaining towns, Beth-le'aphrah
(v 10), Shaphir (v 11), Beth-ezel (v 12), and Maroth
(v 12) are usually associated with the Hill Country
(Elliger 1934a: 125-33). It is clear that Micah's list
does not represent any line of march or systematic
progress through the land of Judah.
The most important action in the entire cam-
paign of Sennacherib was the capture of Lachish as
evidenced by the prominent place accorded to it in
his palace reliefs (Ussishkin 1977: 28-30). Lachish
was besieged while the Assyrians were pressuring
Hezekiah to surrender and open the gates of
Jerusalem (2 Kgs 18:17; 2 Chr 32:9; Isa 36:2). After
it fell, the Assyrians turned their attention to
Libnah (2 Kgs 19:8-9; Isa 37:8). At this point, the
Egyptians prepared to intervene (2 Kgs 19:9; Isa
37:9) with an army under the leadership of Tirhaka
(Taharqa), brother of the current Pharaoh, Sha-
bako (Rainey 1976). According to Sennacherib's
version, he defeated the combined Egyptian and
Nubian forces near Eltekeh. How many of the 46
towns claimed by Sennacherib were taken before
the fall of Lachish and how many after the clash
with the Egyptians is impossible to determine. But
one thing is certain-that large portions of terri-
tory were detached from Judah and given to the
ruler of Gaza. There is no solid indication, how-
ever, of how far into the Shephelah the Philistine
control extended.
The 7th and early 6th centuries B.C.
Josiah. Throughout the first half of the 7th
century, i.e., the reigns of Manasseh and Amon, we
have no details about life in the Shephelah. Most
Judean cities suffered so severely from Sennache-
rib's campaign that they recovered scarcely, if at
all, e.g., Tell Beit Mirsim (as interpreted by
Aharoni 1973: 6). The Assyrian drive to conquer
Egypt (between 679 and 664 B.C.) and to hold it in
vassalage required the support of the Arabs and
the Philistines, the traditional rivals of Judah. So
Judah was left in its restricted position and Manas-
seh, seeking to improve his local economic and
political position, introduced the foreign cults of
his neighbors, the Phoenicians and others (possibly
also the Arabs), undoubtedly bringing diplomatic
ties as in the days of Ahab (2 Kgs 21:3; cf. 1 Kgs
16:31; McKay 1973: 20-27; Cogan 1974: 88-96).
But with the liberation of Egypt from Assyrian rule
(ca. 655 B.c.) and the treachery of the Arabs who
backed Asshurbanipal's brother in his revolt (650-
648 B.C.), the Assyrian king decided to trust
Manasseh and to elevate Judah's local position;
the Judean king had been arrested and taken to
Babylon while Asshurbanipal was completing the
work of reorganizing that province after the revolt
(2 Chr 33:11-17). Now Manasseh removed the
foreign cults, i.e., he broke with his neighbors who
were out of favor with Assyria, and was even
allowed to man the Judean fortified cities once
again. It remains an open question whether he or
his grandson Josiah would have amassed suffi-
cient funds to begin the extensive rebuilding of
such major centers as Lachish II. The return to the
Shephelah can only be dated from the mid-7th
century B.C. at the earliest and the rebuilding of
Lachish II was probably after Josiah had begun to
derive support and revenue from the north (cf.
2 Chr 34:9). One of Josiah's wives, the mother of
Jehoahaz and Zedekiah, was from Libnah (2 Kgs
23:32; 24:18; Jer 52:1). The older of these sons,
Jehoahaz, was born in 632 B.C., when Josiah was
17 years old (he already had one son, Jehoiakim,
born the previous year). So Hamutal, the wife
from Libnah, must have married the young king
no later than 633 B.C., the year Asshurbanipal
died. It was precisely in this year that Josiah, "and
he still a youth, began to seek the God of David his
father" (2 Chr 34:3). Could it be that the Chroni-
cler's statement reflects Josiah's marriage alliance
with some important Levitical family in Libnah? It
was noted earlier, in the reign of Amaziah, that the
Shephelah population inclined towards the reli-
gious institution founded by David in Jerusalem,
in contrast to the Judean nobility of the Hill
Country, who favored the high places and their
16 BASOR 251
BIBLICAL SHEPHELAH OF JUDAH
alien practices. Libnah was famous for having
declared its independence from Joash because of
his abuses of the Levitical priesthood (cf. above).
Thus one might suggest that Libnah, as the leading
Levitical city of the Shephelah, may have had a
role in stimulating the subsequent reforms by King
Josiah.
The unusual find of a few inscriptions in good
Judean Hebrew at the small fort called Mezad
Hashavyahu (Naveh 1977) can apparently be taken
as evidence of Josiah's expansion across northern
Philistia to the sea coast (Aharoni 1979: 403).
Otherwise, no further epigraphic testimonies to
this effect are available. Formerly, the diffusion of
the royal seal impressions (Imlk) was thought to
reflect Josiah's broader sphere of rule, e.g., at
Gezer and Tell es-S&fi (Lance 1971), but the
revised dating of those stamps (and the private seal
impressions as well) to the age of Hezekiah (Ussish-
kin 1977) makes that theory irrelevant. From an
archaeological point of view, the known history of
the 7th century kings of Judah indicates that
Josiah is the logical candidate for the builder of
Lachish Stratum II (B. Mazar, personal communi-
cation). The territory lost due to Sennacherib's
campaign was certainly regained, but the western
border of Josiah's kingdom, facing Philistia, re-
mains undetermined.
Nebuchadrezzar. In spite of all the dramatic
events during the last reigns of the Judean kings,
and the campaigns of Nebuchadrezzar in the
Levant, there are no direct references to the Judean
Shephelah until the very end. Nebuchadrezzar had
conquered Ashkelon in 604 and some other town,
possibly Gaza, in 603 B.c. (Rainey 1975a: 54-55).
In 601, there was a fierce confrontation between
the Egyptian and Babylonian armies, probably in
southern Philistia or northern Sinai. The geograph-
ical location of the battle is unknown. It resulted in
a draw, and both sides suffered heavy losses.
The Babylonian failure to defeat the Egyptians
led Jehoiakim to cease paying his tribute to Nebu-
chadrezzar. While the Babylonian army was being
rehabilitated and refurbished, the Babylonian king
ordered the local troops of neighboring subject
peoples, the Edomites, Moabites, and Ammonites
(2 Kgs 24:2) to attack Judah. It is interesting that
the Philistines were not included, but that is not
surprising since they had taken a strong pro-
Egyptian stance and had suffered for it. It is
unlikely that western Judea, that is, the Shephelah,
suffered from the harrassment against Judah at
that time (600 B.C.). Certainly the neighboring
peoples would not have been able to mount a siege
against strongly fortified cities like Lachish.
It was 598-597 B.c. before the Babylonian army
could make the final move against Jehoiakim. The
biblical (2 Kgs 24:10-17; 2 Chr 36:10, probably also
vv 6b-7; Rainey 1975a: 58) and the Babylonian
(Wiseman 1956) records make it clear that only
Jerusalem was besieged, and it avoided destruction
by surrendering. There is nothing in favor of a
destruction of Judean towns, specially in the She-
phelah, in 597 B.C. The theory of Starkey (1937a:
175-77; 1937b: 235-36) and Albright (1953: 46;
1958: 24), supported by Kenyon (1976) and others,
that Lachish Stratum III was destroyed in 597 has
been thoroughly disproven historically (Rainey
1975a: 53-59) and archaeologically (Ussishkin
1977).
In fact, the last allusions to events in the She-
phelah date to the final campaign (587 B.C.) in
which Nebuchadrezzar brought an end to the
Judean monarchy. His troops overran most of the
fortified cities, as seen by the destruction levels
revealed in excavation. At a late stage in the
conflict, the prophet Jeremiah gave a personal
oracle to king Zedekiah, "when the king of Babylon
was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the
cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and
Azekah" (Jer 34:7). Because he had only Judah to
deal with, and his supply lines were secure from the
west and north, Nebuchadrezzar could afford to
attack the lesser cities throughout Judah, and even
begin his siege of Jerusalem, while leaving Lachish
and Azekah till near the end. The strategic position
of the two sites, each guarding its respective wadi,
received further emphasis.
The collection of inscribed ostraca from the
guard room of Lachish Stratum II also sheds som
light on the events in the Shephelah. Tur-Sina
interpretation of these texts as part of a militar
tribunal held in the gate at Lachish cannot b
sustained (Torczyner 1938), nor can many detail
of his translation. However, it is clear from Letter
No. 4 that at one point, a Judean officer reporte
to Ya'osh, commander at Lachish, "... we are
alert for the fire signals of Lachish according to all
the code-signals given by my lord, because we do
not see Azekah." Perhaps the northern fortress had
already fallen and only Lachish remained. Soon it,
too, succumbed to the Babylonian onslaught as
evidenced by the total destruction of Stratum II.

ANSON F. RAINEY
The Second Temple Period
Under Persian Rule
All that one can say about the Shephelah during
the Persian Period is that its southern districts
probably had become part of what was later called
Idumaea. This came about when the Edomites
moved into southern Judah as far as Hebron.
Nevertheless, some enclaves of Judeans continued
to maintain their existence, as witnessed by Nehe-
miah's list of "the rest of Israel" (Neh 11:25-35).
The Shephelah towns mentioned are Zorah, Jar-
muth, Zanoah, Adullam, Lachish, and Azekah.
These settlements and others in the Hill Country
(Kiriath-arba) and the Negeb were reckoned by
Nehemiah as true members of Israel, in contrast to
the people of Samaria. Perhaps they were the
descendants of the rural population that was left
on the land by Nebuchadrezzar (Jer 40:10; Ezek
33:21-27; Aharoni 1979: 409-10).
Lachish was evidently a major administrative
center of some sort, as witnessed by the impressive
palace of Persian date that stood on the platform
of the former Judean fortress-palace (Tufnell 1977:
746). Another building on the north side of the tell,
House No. 10, has many typical features of a cult
center, e.g., orientation to the sunrise, incense
altar, row of pillars across the presumed "holy
place" (Aharoni 1975b: 9-11), and was probably
designed for ritual functions. On the other hand,
the so-called "Solar Shrine" (name coined by
Starkey; 1937a: 171-72) does not date to the
Persian but rather to the Hellenistic Period (Aha-
roni 1975b: 3-5). Apart from its facing east, it has
nothing to suggest solar worship and certainly no
connection with either Persian or Arabian temples.
Hellenistic Period
Ptolemaic and Seleucid Rule. Throughout the
Hellenistic period the Shephelah was part of Idu-
maea, the southern half of Judea occupied since
the Persian period by Edomites. The one major
town of record is Marisa, i.e., biblical Mareshah.
The Zenon Papyri, records of a commercial agent
from Egypt, include correspondence with an agent
at Marisa (259-258 B.c.). It would appear that a
colony of Sidonians had established themselves
there. The famous tomb nearby contained the
names of Phoenicians such as Sesmaios, Meer-
balos, alongside Idumaeans such as Cosnatanos,
Cosbanos, and also Greeks such as Apollophanes,
head of the Sidonian community at Marisa. The
other inscriptions attest to the mixed Phoenician-
Edomite population and to their gradual Helleni-
zation (Avi-Yonah and Kloner 1977).
Hasmonean Rule. The Maccabean revolt began
at the extreme northern end of the Judean Shephe-
lah, actually in territory outside the original bounds
of the district in the First Temple Period. Modiin
was, of course, the home of the Maccabee family.
Two of Judah's earliest victories were at Beth-
horon (166 B.C.; 1 Macc 3:13-24) and Emmaus
(165 B.c.; 1 Macc 3:38-4:25; 2 Macc 8:8-9). Two
years later, the Maccabean forces under Judah
invaded Idumaea, took Hebron and the surround-
ing towns and then went down to the Shephelah
and attacked Marisa (Jos. Ant. XII, 8:6 [353];
correcting 1 Macc 5:66, which reads "Samaria").
Subsequently he fought another engagement near
Marisa, where the enemy commander was almost
captured. Judah finally withdrew to Adullam (Gk.
Ookkact; 2 Macc 12:32-38).
Apart from the acquisition of Ekron (Accaron)
by Jonathan as a gift from Alexander Balas (147
B.C.; 1 Macc 10:89) and the conquest of Gezer by
Simon (between 142 and 135 B.c.; 1 Macc 13:43
corrected by Jos. War I, 2:2 [50] and Ant. XIII, 6:7
[215]), the next major event to effect the Shephelah
was the conquest of Idumaea by John Hyrcanus
(Jos. War I, 2:6 [63]; Ant. XIII, 9:1 [257]) in
125 B.C. The main centers mentioned in that cam-
paign were Adoraim in the Hill Country and
Marisa in the Shephelah. The Idumaeans were
permitted to remain in their territory provided they
converted to Judaism. It is to this period that we
may associate two temples uncovered in modern
times. One is at Beer-sheba (Aharoni 1975a: 163-
65), dated by coins of Demetrias II, found as
offerings in its foundation trenches, to the year or
so after 126 B.C. The other temple is at Lachish, the
erroneously-labeled "Solar Shrine." Excavations
by Aharoni (1975b: 3-11) produced clear evidence
that it, too, dates to the late second century B.C.
Both temples resemble closely in plan the Arad
temple from the pre-exilic period. The Lachish
temple (and probably that at Beer-sheba) had a
Holy of Holies facing east through a broad room,
the Holy Place, and out onto a courtyard. If there
had once been an altar in the courtyard of the
Lachish temple, its stones had been thoroughly
robbed before the British excavations. No trace of
such an installation was found in the courtyard (in
18 BASOR 251
BIBLICAL SHEPHELAH OF JUDAH
contrast to the Beer-sheba temple). An incense
altar had been thrown out into the courtyard. It
had probably stood at the entrance to the Holy of
Holies. Given the tendency of the Jerusalem priest-
hood to discourage animal sacrifice in local shrines
(cf. the problems about restoring the burnt offer-
ings at Yeb in Egypt during the Persian Period;
Porten 1968: 289-93), it is possible that incense
was the only ritual offering in the Lachish temple.
If so, then that shrine may be viewed as a link
between the local "high places" of the First Temple
Period and the local synagogues of the Greco-
Roman Period (Rainey 1975d: 209-10).
Herodian Period. With the Roman reorgani-
zation of the Hasmonean kingdom by Pompey (63)
and Gabinius (57 B.c.), Marisa and its surrounding
district was made an independent Hellenic city
(Jos. Ant. IV 4:4 [75], 5:3 [88]; War I, 7:7 [-56], 8:4
[166]). During the invasion by the Parthians (40
B.C.), Marisa was razed, never to rise again (Ant.
XIV, 13:9 [364]; War I, 13:9 [269]). Within a year,
the entire area of western Idumaea was placed
under the rule of Herod (Appian, Civil War, V, 75;
Avi-Yonah 1977: 87). Two towns that were evi-
dently centers of Herodian toparchies are known
from the sources, viz., Beth-letepha (Beit Nattif;
Pliny NH, V, 15 [70]; Jos. War, IV, 8:1 [445]) and
Beth-guvrin (correcting BlcTaSptv to *BlToyapptv;
Avi-Yonah 1977: 96). Early in the First Jewish
War (A.D. 66), we hear of brief action by the rebels
going out from Sallis (or *Saallis; Jos. War, III,
2:2 [20]), evidently Kefar Shihlaim (Kh. Shalkhah;
Jeru. Taanith 69a; Avi-Yonah 1976:91) and f
sanctuary at Bethzedek (Jos. War III, 2:
Deir Sa'ad; Avi-Yonah 1976: 42). Vespasia
the Shephelah in A.D. 68 (Jos. War IV, 7:1 [
Roman Byzantine Period
Evidence from coins shows that in A.D. 200
Septimus Severus transformed Betogabris (Beth-
guvrin) into Eleutheropolis, "the City of the Free
(Jones 1971: 278-79). The rabbis made a play on
the name in Hebrew and called it "the City o
Dwellers in Holes" (Mid. Gen. R. 41-42), Ihorlm =
"holes," and "free men." Jerome called it Chor-
rhaeos (Ep. of Paula, XVIII). This newly founded
metropolis became the administrative capital of
the entire Daroma district including the toparchy
of Bethletepha (detached from Jerusalem), all the
southern Shephelah, and the southern Judean Hills.
As such, it also appears in the Onomasticon of
Eusebius as the principle base for giving the geo
graphical locations of biblical towns (Beyer 193 lb).
The plethora of village-type sites from antiquity
on most of the hills and throughout the valleys
from the Roman-Byzantine period testifies to the
heavy population supported by the Shephelah in
that period. The abandonment of so many of those
sites and the absence of such a high percentage o
ancient (biblical and Talmudic) place names from
the Arabic toponymy indicate that a drastic turn
over in population has taken place since the Mos-
lem conquest.
