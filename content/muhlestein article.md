Kerry Muhlestein/Papyri and Presumptions 41
Henry Tressler Account, 1838
Henry Tressler seems to have met Joseph Smith during the period
in which Smith was in Missouri, thus after the fragments had been
mounted on paper at the end of 1837. While he learned something
about the source of the Book of Abraham, it is not clear who told him
about it. Because he obtained some of the mummy wrappings at the
time he learned of the papyri, and because it seems most likely that
only Joseph Smith would feel free to give him something like that,
it is likely that Tressler is a firsthand witness, having learned from
Joseph Smith himself about the papyri’s relationship to the Book of
Abraham. We do not get the account from Tressler himself, but rather
from an 1897 interview. Thus, while Tressler was probably a firsthand
witness, what we get from him is secondhand, at best. It is reported
that Tressler “saw the rolls of Papyrus from which the Pearl of Great

Price was translated, and procured a piece of the bandage that was
wrapped around one of the mummies exhibited by Mr. Chandler.” 26
While Tressler’s biographer does not appear to be trying to distin-
guish between the papyrus fragments and rolls, he is specific that,
after having spoken with Joseph Smith about the antiquities, Tressler
recounted that the rolls (or scrolls) were the source of the Book of
Abraham. Tressler’s acquisition of this knowledge would have been
after the original of Facsimile One and its accompanying text were
mounted on paper separately from the scrolls. It is possible that
Tressler or Smith would refer to the fragments that came from the
scrolls as part of the roll, but later accounts make this seem less likely.
William I. Appleby Account, 1841 In 1848, William I. Appleby, a faithful member of the Church,
recorded a visit he had with the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1841.
Because it was recorded seven years after the event, we must be
cognizant that Appleby’s recollection may be flawed. However, the
account contains so many specific details it seems likely this entry
was based on something he may have written even earlier. Appleby
heard about the papyri from Joseph Smith, making this a firsthand
account. Appleby’s account is too long to reproduce here, but the
pertinent parts are included.

Evening News (July 24, 1897): 10.
42 The Journal of Mormon History
The Prophet showed Appleby the mummies and the scrolls.
Appleby said that he “saw the Rolls of PAPYRUS, AND THE Writings
theron, taken from off the bosom of the Male Mummy, being some
of the writings of ancient Abrham and of Joseph, that was sold into
Egypt.”27 Appleby further explained that “the writings are chiefly
in the Egyptian language, with the exception of a little Hebrew, I
believe. They give a description of some of the scenes in Ancient
Egypt, of their worship, their Idol Gods, and cetera. The writings
are beautiful and plain, composed of red, and black ink. There is a
percepeble difference between the writings. Joseph appears to have
been the best scribe.”28 Appleby recalled more vignettes. He said the
papyri contained “representations of men, beasts, Birds, Idols, and
Oxen attached to a kind of a Plough, and a female guiding it. Also
the serpent when he beguiled Eve. He appears with two legs, erect
in the form and appearance of man. But his head in the form, and
representing the Serpent, with his forked tongue extended.”29
While the papyri fragments we now have match some of those
descriptions, such as a plowing scene in JSP II, many of these scenes
are not found on any of the extant fragments. We do have a depic-
tion of one bird on JSP V, and another on JSP VI. These may be the
“birds” Appleby refers to, but we cannot tell. Some figures on JSP VI
could be described as “beasts,” though that is not the most obvious
description. None of the figures are likely to be described as idols,
though it is difficult to know what Appleby would have given that
label. We do have a representation of a legged serpent on JSP V,
but not with the tongue extended. Furthermore, Appleby’s account
confirms that the Prophet at least sometimes indicated to his friends
which scroll contained the writings of Joseph and which belonged to
Abraham.
This journal entry provides even more valuable information.
Appleby’s description helps us realize that the more beautiful writ-
ing Oliver Cowdery had described belonged to the scroll with Joseph
Smith’s book on it. He seems to believe the manuscript with Joseph
of Egypt’s writings on it had been written by Joseph of Egypt himself.
Additionally, we can be sure that there was much more to the papyri
than that which we now have, since he described many pictures that

Kerry Muhlestein/Papyri and Presumptions 43
do not match those on the eleven fragments still available. He also
describes the writings as being on the “roll” even after the fragments
had been separated.
Charlotte Haven Account, 1843
Charlotte Haven visited Nauvoo in 1843 and wrote about her experi-
ences in letters to her mother, which were later published. Her account
indicates that the long roll contained the writings of Abraham. She
also described scenes from the roll that must have contained the
writings of Joseph of Egypt, as it accords with Appleby’s account and
is also similar to Cowdery’s.
Haven and her friends were shown the mummies and papyri by
Lucy Mack Smith. Mother Smith “opened a long roll of manuscript,
saying it was ‘the writing of Abraham and Isaac, written in Hebrew
and Sanscrit.’”30 She also described scenes from the other roll, one
of which was “Mother Eve being tempted by the serpent, who—the
serpent, I mean—was standing on the tip of his tail, which with his
two legs formed a tripod, and had his head in Eve’s ear.”31
A number of interesting things must be discussed from this
account. First, the Prophet’s mother, presumably informed by the
Prophet (making Haven’s writings a secondhand account of inter-
pretations) said that the long roll contained the writings of Abraham.
This is after the fragments we now have were mounted, indicating
that the scroll, rather than the fragments, were being designated as
containing the writings of Abraham.
Second, Haven, who is an eyewitness of the papyri, described
scenes from the roll that must have contained the writings of Joseph.
Her descriptions are similar to Cowdery’s but have enough detail,
such as the snake whispering in Eve’s ear while its legs and tail formed
a tripod, that we can determine she is describing scenes that are not
on any of the extant papyri. This accords with Appleby’s account
that the snake had his tongue out, which is not the case in any of
the papyri we have today. This forces us to question whether or not
Cowdery was describing scenes that survive on papyri today or if he
too was speaking of something that we no longer have.

Benjamin Ashby Account, 1843
Benjamin Ashby is a secondhand account of the source of the Book
of Abraham and also seems to indicate that the long roll, rather than
the mounted fragments, was the original source.
Ashby was a fifteen-year-old recent convert when he saw the papyri
in November 1843, though he recorded the event many years later as
he created an autobiography. He recalled, “One day with my mother
and I visited his [Joseph Smith’s] house, he was not in, but we spent
an interesting time with his mother. She exhibited the mummies
from which the Book of Abraham was taken as well as the original
papyrus on which it was written.”32 Ashby’s visit was after some papyri
had been mounted and framed. It is not fully clear but it appears
that his reference to “the original papyrus” refers to the long roll as
the source, since he does not mention frames or slides as is typical
when they were exhibited.
Unnamed Observer Account, 1846
One man, whose written account is simply attributed to “M,” came
through Nauvoo in 1846 and wrote about the time he was shown the
mummies and papyri by Lucy Mack Smith, making him a secondhand
witness regarding the source of the Book of Abraham. His account
also described the long roll as the source and described vignettes
that are not found on extant papyri. In addition, in accordance with
other accounts, he reported that the Prophet could read parts of the
inscription that had been destroyed.
He recorded, “She produced a black looking roll (which she told
us was papyrus) found upon the breast of the King, part of which the
Prophet had unrolled and read; and she had pasted the deciphered
sheets on the leaves of a book which she showed us.” 33 He further
explained that “The roll was as dark as the bones of the Mummies,
and bore very much the same appearance; but the opened sheets
[presumably the mounted fragments] were exceedingly like thin
parchment, and of quite a light color. There were birds, fishes, and
fantastic looking people, interspersed amidst hyeroglyphics.” 34 After
some discussion about their meaning, Lucy Mack Smith described
something of Joseph Smith’s translation process, noting that “where

34 Ibid.
Kerry Muhlestein/Papyri and Presumptions 45
the papyrus was torn, he could read the parts that were destroyed
equally as well as those that were there.”35
From this account we learn that the Prophet had only unrolled
and deciphered part of the roll. The fact that Lucy Mack Smith had
a translation of what was on the scroll indicates that she thought the
Book of Abraham came from that scroll, not the mounted fragments,
though the account is not completely clear on this. Not only does
the wording suggest this interpretation but such a reading accords
with other accounts.
It is not clear if the phrase “she had pasted the deciphered sheets
on the leaves of a book” means that Mother Smith pasted the part of
the papyri that had been deciphered into a book, or if it meant she
had pasted the translation into a book. If it refers to sheets of papyrus,
then at least part of what Joseph Smith had translated was no longer
on the scroll but was also not among the framed slides, as it had been
glued into a book. It seems far more likely that the phrase refers to
the translation, since an earlier visitor had mentioned an “octavo”
with Joseph Smith’s translation in it, from which Mother Smith read
to those who came to view the mummies and papyri.36 We have no
information as to the eventual fate of this octavo.
Other things learned from this account are that the roll was
quite distinguishable from the fragments due to its color and that
some of the scenes the unknown observer saw on the fragments, if he
recalled correctly, are no longer extant, since we have no depictions
of fish. While this is a thirdhand account of the translation process,
it is interesting to note that Mother Smith indicated that at least
part of the translation process was revelation of a no-longer-existing
text, rather than translation of a text in front of the Prophet. This
idea is corroborated by another visitor who wrote that “these records
were torn by being taken from the roll of embalming salve which
contained them, and some parts entirely lost; but Smith is able to
translate the whole by divine inspiration, and that which is lost, like
Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, can be interpreted as well as that which is
preserved.” 37 These statements suggest that we do not know to what

degree the “translation” of the Book of Abraham came from the
papyri as opposed to pure revelation.
Jerusha Blanchard Account, 1852–1856
One of Hyrum Smith’s granddaughters, Jerusha Blanchard, recounted
some of her girlhood adventures during regular visits with her Aunt
Emma and Great Grandmother Lucy Mack Smith and also indicated
that the long roll was the source of the Book of Abraham, though it
is a recollection made years later.
Her visits, made between 1852 and 1856, frequently included
playing hide-and-seek among the mummies. She recalled, some sixty-
five years later, “In the arms of the Old King, lay the roll of papyrus
from which our prophet translated the Book of Abraham.” 38 The
account is firsthand regarding the papyri and secondhand regarding
the source of the Book of Abraham.
Joseph Smith III Account, 1898
One last account is worth examining. Joseph Smith III recollected
years later things he had been told about the mummies, papyri,
and records, indicating that the source of the Book of Abraham was
destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire.
Some of his account is mistaken, such as his belief that it was Wil-
liam Smith who sold the papyri to the Woods Museum. His account
is a late enough hearsay retelling with enough problems to demand
a cautious use. Still, we must note that he describes the source of the
Book of Abraham. He said, “The papyrus from which the Book of
Abraham, was said to have been translated by Father, was with other
portions found in a roll with some Egyptian mummies, pasted on either
paper or linen and put into a small case of flat drawers, some dozen
or sixteen in number.”39 Smith went on to say that this case contain-
ing the papyri was sold to the Woods Museum and were destroyed. It
is difficult to know what Smith meant when he said that the roll was
pasted on either paper or linen and put in a case. It is possible that
Smith was referring to the papyrus sheets that were pasted to paper
and mounted under glass, some of which we know were kept in a
kind of cabinet. If the “dozen or sixteen in number” refers to papyrus

Herald, October 24, 1898.
Kerry Muhlestein/Papyri and Presumptions 47
fragments, this interpretation is strengthened. Yet grammatically it
seems more likely that the “dozen or sixteen” was referring to the
number of drawers, though it is not completely clear. At the same time,
many eyewitnesses referred to the papyri themselves as being made
of linen or parchment, so this description is ambiguous. Additionally,
while someone could describe the mounted fragments as being glued
to paper, it seems very unlikely that anyone would describe them as
being pasted to linen. Furthermore, Smith spoke of the contents
of the cabinet being sold to the museum and burning. He claimed
to have personally seen the mummies and cabinet of papyri in the
museum before it burned. He must have been referring to papyri
that no longer exists, presumably the scrolls. Thus, while the account
is somewhat confusing, it indicates that Joseph Smith III considered
the papyri that burned in the Great Chicago Fire to be the source
of the Book of Abraham, not the papyri that remains. The language
Smith uses, “Was said to have been translated,” suggests that he did
not get this information from his father, but from others, making him
a secondhand account regarding the source of the Book of Abraham.
Having examined all the pertinent documents, we should also
address the quality of the sources. While there are historiographic
shortcomings in many, there are also some strengths. Notably, these
accounts span the full length of time that Joseph Smith possessed the
papyri in question. I have examined at least one account from most of
the ten years Smith owned the papyri. While it would be preferable to
have more firsthand accounts of what Joseph Smith said was the source
of the Book of Abraham, we do have accounts from a variety of sources
with a surprising amount of agreement between these disparate kinds
of documents. While we do not have an account from Joseph Smith
himself, we have a few firsthand accounts regarding what he said about
the source and many more secondhand accounts, including those that
are most specific about the source of the Book of Abraham. Thus,
the conclusions drawn from the writings of Joseph Smith III, Haven,
and Blanchard are not as strong as are historiographically ideal. Still
they are our best historical sources and lend a strong weight to the
way the sources that are slightly less clear should be interpreted. On
the whole, it is an impressive collection of historical sources.
The Book of Abraham’s Source
Some eyewitnesses, namely Oliver Cowdery, Luman Shurtliff, and
William I. Appleby, do not indicate anything one way or the other
as to the source of the Book of Abraham, though they do provide
48 The Journal of Mormon History
valuable clues. The accounts of Henry Tressler, Benjamin Ashby, and
“M” indicate that the long scroll was the source of that book, though
it is possible to interpret them in other ways. Two of the accounts that
are clear about the source of the Book of Abraham, Charlotte Haven
and Jerusha Blanchard, both agree that it came from the long roll.
Both of these are secondhand accounts. Joseph Smith III does not
specify that the long roll was the source of the Book of Abraham but
does indicate that it was papyrus that we no longer have. While not
every account is fully clear, the united voice of the whole confirms
that the long roll was the source of the Book of Abraham. This is the
only scenario that can reconcile all the accounts.40
Actually, when all the accounts are taken together, it is more accu-
rate to say that the aggregate of the sources dictates that the long roll
is the source for Joseph Smith’s inspiration as he revealed the Book
of Abraham. While the long roll is clearly involved, it is not clear if
the “translation” was from the characters on the long roll or if the
Prophet had the text revealed to him as he studied it, whether that
writing was present on the scroll or not. Lucy Mack Smith’s avowals
that her son could translate the text of the Book of Abraham whether
or not it was on the papyrus suggests that the hieroglyphs may not
have been as necessary to the translation as many have supposed.

Having recounted all the pertinent accounts, what conclusions can
be drawn? While there is much that we don’t know, there are some
things we can deduce:
1. The Saints possessed two scrolls, one beautifully written and the
other less appealing, though still striking, in appearance.
2. The nicely written scroll was apparently considered to be the Book
of Joseph. Much, perhaps all, of what was described of this scroll we
no longer have.
3. The less well written, but longer, scroll in some way combined with
inspiration to be the source of the Book of Abraham.
4. At some point (almost certainly in Kirtland toward the end of 1837)
some fragments were glued to paper and mounted in framed glass.
The fragments acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art are
likely most, if not all, of these mounted papyri.
5. Some fragments seem to have come from the shorter scroll. Some may
have been unattached to a roll at all when they were first acquired.
6. Some of these fragments probably came from the long scroll. After
the fragments had been mounted, witnesses continued to refer to
50 The Journal of Mormon History
the long roll as the inspiration-based source of the Book of Abra-
ham. Thus, the extant fragments are not the source of the Book of
Abraham.
7. This also indicates that the roll must have contained quite a bit more
on it than the Book of Breathings (if that came from the long roll),
since after much of that text was seemingly cut off, that roll was still
regarded as the “long roll,” in contrast with a roll that contained at
least much of the Book of the Dead (the text that is likely present on
the shorter roll), a text that is typically much longer than the Book
of Breathings.
8. This supposition is strengthened by the fact that several eyewitnesses
describe scenes from the papyri that are not present on the extant
fragments, suggesting that a great deal of what they were looking at
is on the scrolls that were burned in Chicago. Combining this with
the descriptions of the length of the scrolls makes it clear that only
a minority of the papyri has survived, most likely the damaged outer
edges of the scrolls that were mounted, presumably to preserve them
from further deterioration.41
9. It may be that at some point part of what Joseph Smith had deciphered
was cut off and mounted on paper in the leaves of a book, which
we no longer have. More likely it was the translation itself that was
mounted in the book.
10. Even though the witnesses say the longer roll is the source of the
Book of Abraham, it is unclear how much of the translation process
centered on the text and how much was pure revelation, regardless
of the text.
Misconceptions Made Manifest
In the end, while there are many more questions we must answer, our
only historical evidence leads to the deduction that the few mounted
fragments we now have are not the source of the Book of Abraham.
Thus we must also conclude that those who used propinquity as their
basis, and thus thought the text adjacent to the Sacrifice of Abraham
Vignette was the source of the Book of Abraham, were doing so
based on a false assumption and a faulty methodology. While there is
much we still have to learn about the papyri, the source of the Book
of Abraham, and the translation process, and while the eyewitness
accounts do not answer many of these questions, they at least tell us
what the source was not. These accounts demonstrate that the frag-
ments we now have are not what the early Saints thought was the
source of the Book of Abraham.

Papyri and Presumptions:
A Careful Examination
of the Eyewitness Accounts
Associated with the
Joseph Smith Papyri

Kerry Muhlestein

KERRY MUHLESTEIN received his PhD from UCLA in Egyptology. He is a professor in the Ancient Scripture Department at Brigham Young University, where he directs the Egypt Excavation Project. He has served in various positions for the American Research Center in Egypt and as vice president of the Society for the Study of Egyptian Antiquities/ Société pour l’Étude de l’Égypte Ancienne. He is a senior fellow of the William F. Albright Institute for Archaeological Research and has been appointed as a visiting fellow at the University of Oxford for the 2016–17 academic year. In 1967 the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City presented The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with ten papyri fragments. These papyri were glued to 1830’s period scratch paper on which architectural plans for an LDS temple to be built in Independence, Missouri, and maps of the Kirtland, Ohio, area were drawn.1 These unique drawings, coupled with the presence of the original of the Book of Abraham’s Facsimile One on one of the fragments, along with a receipt from Emma Smith, led to the conclusion that these were some of the papyri Joseph Smith purchased from a traveling exhibition of Egyptian antiquities.2 The existence of these fragments was unexpected, since it was previously believed that all of Joseph Smith’s papyri had been destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. The rediscovery sparked a great deal of research. Resulting investigations determined that after Emma Smith had sold the papyri to Abel Combs, he gave a small portion to his housekeeper before selling the majority of the papyri to a museum in St. Louis. Her descendants sold their collection to the Metropolitan Museum. This led to the collection’s eventual resurfacing in the public eye. 3 At this point the papyri were numbered, with each fragment receiving the name Joseph Smith Papyrus (abbreviated as JSP) I, II, and so on. The appearance of these papyri caused quite a stir among those who were interested in Joseph Smith’s revelatory abilities. The fragment on which the Sacrifice of Abraham Vignette appeared was surrounded by many Egyptian hieroglyphs, suggesting that this text might be a source for at least some of the text found today in the Book of Abraham. Some believing Latter-day Saints thought that these hieroglyphs, once translated, would provide solid evidence that Joseph Smith could translate ancient texts through inspiration. Anti-Mormons believed the opposite: they were confident that the translated text would disprove Joseph Smith’s prophetic abilities.4 The fragment thus became the center of an ideological battle. Both groups acted on the same assumption, namely, that the proximity of text and picture demanded that they were associated with each other, and thus the text that surrounded the drawing on JSP I had to be the text that Joseph Smith translated into the Book of Abraham. While this was a natural assumption to make, in situations like this, a problem lies in failing to recognize that one has made assumptions or has not carefully examined and tested those assumptions. 5 These types of postulations are not problematic; they are part of the academic process. However, after this logical first step, the next step should have been to examine whether or not the groups had evidence that could support or discredit the conjecture. When stated thus, such an investigation seems obvious. The problem was that the assumption seemed more obvious, so initially no one took the time to examine the initial presumption. In other words, a host of writings based on this unexamined propinquity assumption have continued to come forth since 1967.6 Some of these writings are research-rich in certain aspects of the Joseph Smith Papyri, but they are inevitably research-poor in other aspects. Much of this is because of the blind spot created by failing to recognize a key assumption has been made.7 While some work has been done on various ways to examine the initial presumption made about the source of the Book of Abraham,8 surprisingly little has been done in examining the eyewitness accounts of those who saw the papyri and knew from what source Joseph Smith said he was translating. Such accounts constitute the historical record, and thus modern speculations about the extant papyri or the role of the Kirtland Egyptian Papers must be superseded by eyewitnesses from Joseph Smith’s day.9


Eyewitness Accounts

There are dozens of eyewitness accounts regarding the appearance of the papyri, but here I will limit myself to the nine eyewitnesses who shed some light on the question of the source of the Book of Abraham.10 While most of the accounts do not paint a fully clear picture, taken together the only scenario that can reconcile all of the accounts is that the long scroll was the source for the Book of Abraham—or at least it was the source for inspiration behind the Book of Abraham, an issue that will be addressed below. I had initially intended to include statements from eyewitnesses about whose handwriting was thought to be on various portions of the papyri. But such statements must have been based on assumptions that if a manuscript contains a text authored by someone, then the handwriting of the author must therefore be on that manuscript. 11 Because these eyewitnesses and their contemporaries were not familiar with ancient scribal copying practices, we cannot blame them for making such an assumption, even though it is almost surely incorrect. Furthermore, these same people probably assumed that an entire scroll contained just one text authored by just one person. Again, this is unlikely: large scrolls could contain several texts with several different original authors. Combining the two assumptions means that many who viewed the papyri would assume that the original author of a portion of a papyrus would have left his handwriting throughout the entire scroll, an assumption that is unjustifiable. Thus, the discussions on handwriting prove to not be pertinent to the current line of investigation.12 To understand the following accounts, we must know something of the history of the papyri. This first large collection of Egyptian artifacts to arrive in the United States became a traveling exhibition that worked its way along the East Coast.13 After some time, the owners of the exhibition started to sell the collection piecemeal. Eventually it arrived in Kirtland, Ohio, where Joseph Smith felt inspired to acquire the papyri. However, the proprietor of the collection would not part with the papyri separately but instead insisted on selling what remained of the collection as a whole. Thus when Joseph Smith acquired the antiquities, he purchased four mummies and two papyrus scrolls, one larger than the other, as well as an unknown number of papyri fragments. Throughout the Prophet’s lifetime, the scrolls and mummies were exhibited together, frequently by his mother. After his death, his mother continued the practice of exhibiting the mummies along with the papyri, and thus many of the following accounts mention both the Prophet and his mother. I will not discuss the mummies in this article, since they are not germane to the point being examined here, except when mention of the mummies helps to clarify something about the papyri. Sometime before Joseph Smith’s exodus from Ohio in 1838 (or perhaps shortly thereafter) some papyrus fragments were glued to scratch paper and mounted under glass. This most likely happened in 1837 or early 1838.14 The earliest descriptions of the papyri mention only a few fragments, yet at least eleven ended up being mounted under glass.15 Moreover, the original of Facsimile Two, which would have been a fragment as well, is not among those fragments we now have; this would indicate the existence of at least twelve fragments. Because twelve seems to be more than the few that are described as being part of the collection when it was first acquired by Joseph Smith, it is a reasonable assumption that many of the framed fragments we now have were the damaged ends of two long scrolls, which were cut off and mounted in order to protect them from further deterioration. While this assumption is reasonable and best fits the current evidence, we cannot be sure of this. We do not have any nineteenth-century accounts that speak of why some fragments were mounted. As will be seen below, based on descriptions of the papyri, it seems as if portions of both of the scrolls were mounted and framed. The vignette depicting the sacrifice of Abraham appears to be one of those fragments that was separated from the long roll and mounted, although we cannot be sure of this. Its deteriorated condition makes it quite likely that this was done in order to protect it. The outer edges of scrolls are often far more damaged than the inner portions. Differentiating between the mounted fragments and the longer rolls is an important component to understanding what eyewitnesses were referring to when they spoke of the source of the Book of Abraham. Thus, part of what we want to trace is what was said about the source of the Book of Abraham before and after the fragments were mounted on backing paper as well as whether or not there were any changes over time regarding what was said about the papyri. In line with this aim, I will examine the accounts in chronological order according to when the papyri were seen by the eyewitnesses. Some of these accounts were recorded soon thereafter, and some many years later. This will be noted in each account, as well as whether they are firsthand or secondhand witnesses of Joseph Smith’s thoughts regarding the source of the Book of Abraham. Most accounts are secondhand or thirdhand, an issue that will be addressed below. Many of the records are too long to include the entire account, in which case I quote only that which is germane to our specific topic. If the account is short, I include the entire account.

Oliver Cowdery Account, 1835
Once the Prophet had purchased the papyri, his contemporaries started describing them in various letters, journals, and newspaper accounts. Oliver Cowdery, who served as Joseph Smith’s scribe for part of the translation and was thus a firsthand witness of Smith’s thoughts regarding the papyri, penned one of the most comprehensive descriptions of the scrolls in a personal letter that was published in the Messenger and Advocate.16 Cowdery wrote that Smith was involved in helping him as he wrote about the historical events pertaining to the Church. He also noted that he was sometimes involved in the papyrus translation efforts. Thus his writings carry some weight in regards to Smith’s opinions.17 Describing the “writings of Abraham and Joseph,” Cowdery said they were “beautifully written on papyrus with black, and a small part, red ink or paint, in perfect preservation. The characters are such as you find upon the coffins of mummies, hieroglyphics, &c. with many of the characters or letters exactly like the present, (though probably not quite so square,) form of the Hebrew without points.” 18 He also wrote that there were “two or three other small pieces of papyrus, with astronomical calculations, epitaphs, &c.”19 This latter description may have been speaking of the source of Facsimile Two or of a translation of Abraham chapter three. Cowdery went on to describe several drawings on the papyri. Regarding the scroll of Joseph, he spoke of a representation of the godhead “three, yet in one, is curiously drawn to give simply, though impressively, the writers views of that exalted personage.”20 He also described a walking serpent that he felt was part of the Garden of Eden story and mentioned that there was also a representation of “Enoch’s Pillar.”21 A few of the papyrus fragments we have today contain pic- tures that may be those to which Cowdery was referring. For example, fragments V–VII are beautifully written in black with a little red ink. JSP V has a vignette that may be Cowdery’s idea of Enoch’s Pillar and another vignette that depicts a walking serpent speaking with a figure Cowdery may have thought of as a woman. JSP IV contains a depiction of three people seated together that may be what Cowdery thought of as the godhead. Of course he may have been referring to depictions we no longer have, but these fragments seem to fit his description. Incidentally, while we cannot be sure that these fragments came from the shorter scroll, based on content and names on the papyri, it seems likely. These papyri fragments are from the Egyptian Book of the Dead, another document designed to help people reach the desired state and place in the afterlife. If these fragments did come from the shorter scroll, then we know that at least part of the contents of that scroll would be a Book of the Dead. Cowdery also said that he could not tell how voluminous the translation would be but he thought it would be quite long.22 It seems possible that he and Smith had already translated more of the Book of Abraham than we currently have. 23 Cowdery’s admission of not knowing how much they would have may indicate that they did not know how much of the scroll was taken up by the writings of Abraham. Sadly, when describing the beautiful writing and the Hebrew char- acters, Cowdery did not differentiate between the writings of Abraham and Joseph, though apparently Joseph Smith had informed him which was which. Still there is much we can learn from his account. First, the Book of Abraham and the Book of Joseph were on two different rolls. Second, Oliver felt free to speculate about what the scenes on the papyri represented, perhaps with input from Smith. Third, parts of the papyri that Oliver described have been lost. Fourth, it is pos- sible that the Saints did not know how much of the scroll was taken up by the writings of Abraham.

Luman Shurtliff Account, 1837

Luman Andros Shurtliff visited Kirtland at the end of 1837 and wrote about it many years later. He does not discuss whether long rolls or sheets of papyrus were the source of the Book of Abraham, but rather associates the whole of the papyrus that came with the mummies as the source. Still, the account is important because it helps us more fully evaluate later descriptions by providing a terminus ante quem (1837) for the mounting of the fragments that we now have. Shurtliff was an eyewitness of the papyri, though it is not clear whether he learned from Joseph Smith himself about the source of the Book of Abraham or from someone else. About seeing the papyri on December 6, 1837, he recorded Examined the mumies, five in number, looked at the parchment or Papyrus, as called in Egyptain language. The parchment appeared to be made of fine linnen cloth, starched or sized with some kind of gum, then ironed smooth and written in charter, figures, heiro- glyphics, and conveying the Egyptain language. These sheets were about eight by twelve inches. They were rolled, put in a gum case and laid on the breast of the leading men of the Egyptians. When the mummies were found this record was on his breast. Their bodies seemed to be wound up each limb by itself, with several thicknesses of very fine cloth dipped in gum or pitch like thick tar or rosin and wound on when warm. [. . .] It was from this record that the Pearl of Great Price was translated by the Prophet.24 While this account is not specific about the source of the Book of Abraham, it does describe what seems to be a number of smaller fragments. Shurtliff’s report of sheets that were about “eight by twelve inches,” suggests that a number of fragments had been cut and mounted already by the end of 1837. This supports research done on the handwriting on the backs of the papyri about when those documents could have been created.25

Henry Tressler Account, 1838

Henry Tressler seems to have met Joseph Smith during the period in which Smith was in Missouri, thus after the fragments had been mounted on paper at the end of 1837. While he learned something about the source of the Book of Abraham, it is not clear who told him about it. Because he obtained some of the mummy wrappings at the time he learned of the papyri, and because it seems most likely that only Joseph Smith would feel free to give him something like that, it is likely that Tressler is a firsthand witness, having learned from Joseph Smith himself about the papyri’s relationship to the Book of Abraham. We do not get the account from Tressler himself, but rather from an 1897 interview. Thus, while Tressler was probably a firsthand witness, what we get from him is secondhand, at best. It is reported that Tressler “saw the rolls of Papyrus from which the Pearl of Great Price was translated, and procured a piece of the bandage that was wrapped around one of the mummies exhibited by Mr. Chandler.” 26 While Tressler’s biographer does not appear to be trying to distinguish between the papyrus fragments and rolls, he is specific that, after having spoken with Joseph Smith about the antiquities, Tressler recounted that the rolls (or scrolls) were the source of the Book of Abraham. Tressler’s acquisition of this knowledge would have been after the original of Facsimile One and its accompanying text were mounted on paper separately from the scrolls. It is possible that Tressler or Smith would refer to the fragments that came from the scrolls as part of the roll, but later accounts make this seem less likely. William I. Appleby Account, 1841 In 1848, William I. Appleby, a faithful member of the Church, recorded a visit he had with the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1841. Because it was recorded seven years after the event, we must be cognizant that Appleby’s recollection may be flawed. However, the account contains so many specific details it seems likely this entry was based on something he may have written even earlier. Appleby heard about the papyri from Joseph Smith, making this a firsthand account. Appleby’s account is too long to reproduce here, but the pertinent parts are included. The Prophet showed Appleby the mummies and the scrolls. Appleby said that he “saw the Rolls of PAPYRUS, AND THE Writings theron, taken from off the bosom of the Male Mummy, being some of the writings of ancient Abrham and of Joseph, that was sold into Egypt.”27 Appleby further explained that “the writings are chiefly in the Egyptian language, with the exception of a little Hebrew, I believe. They give a description of some of the scenes in Ancient Egypt, of their worship, their Idol Gods, and cetera. The writings are beautiful and plain, composed of red, and black ink. There is a percepeble difference between the writings. Joseph appears to have been the best scribe.”28 Appleby recalled more vignettes. He said the papyri contained “representations of men, beasts, Birds, Idols, and Oxen attached to a kind of a Plough, and a female guiding it. Also the serpent when he beguiled Eve. He appears with two legs, erect in the form and appearance of man. But his head in the form, and representing the Serpent, with his forked tongue extended.”29 While the papyri fragments we now have match some of those descriptions, such as a plowing scene in JSP II, many of these scenes are not found on any of the extant fragments. We do have a depic- tion of one bird on JSP V, and another on JSP VI. These may be the “birds” Appleby refers to, but we cannot tell. Some figures on JSP VI could be described as “beasts,” though that is not the most obvious description. None of the figures are likely to be described as idols, though it is difficult to know what Appleby would have given that label. We do have a representation of a legged serpent on JSP V, but not with the tongue extended. Furthermore, Appleby’s account confirms that the Prophet at least sometimes indicated to his friends which scroll contained the writings of Joseph and which belonged to Abraham. This journal entry provides even more valuable information. Appleby’s description helps us realize that the more beautiful writing Oliver Cowdery had described belonged to the scroll with Joseph Smith’s book on it. He seems to believe the manuscript with Joseph of Egypt’s writings on it had been written by Joseph of Egypt himself. Additionally, we can be sure that there was much more to the papyri than that which we now have, since he described many pictures that do not match those on the eleven fragments still available. He also describes the writings as being on the “roll” even after the fragments had been separated. 

Charlotte Haven Account, 1843

Charlotte Haven visited Nauvoo in 1843 and wrote about her experi-
ences in letters to her mother, which were later published. Her account
indicates that the long roll contained the writings of Abraham. She also described scenes from the roll that must have contained the
writings of Joseph of Egypt, as it accords with Appleby’s account and is also similar to Cowdery’s.
Haven and her friends were shown the mummies and papyri by Lucy Mack Smith. Mother Smith “opened a long roll of manuscript, saying it was ‘the writing of Abraham and Isaac, written in Hebrew and Sanscrit.’”30 She also described scenes from the other roll, one of which was “Mother Eve being tempted by the serpent, who—the serpent, I mean—was standing on the tip of his tail, which with his two legs formed a tripod, and had his head in Eve’s ear.”31 A number of interesting things must be discussed from this account. First, the Prophet’s mother, presumably informed by the Prophet (making Haven’s writings a secondhand account of interpretations) said that the long roll contained the writings of Abraham. This is after the fragments we now have were mounted, indicating that the scroll, rather than the fragments, were being designated as containing the writings of Abraham. Second, Haven, who is an eyewitness of the papyri, described scenes from the roll that must have contained the writings of Joseph. Her descriptions are similar to Cowdery’s but have enough detail, such as the snake whispering in Eve’s ear while its legs and tail formed a tripod, that we can determine she is describing scenes that are not on any of the extant papyri. This accords with Appleby’s account that the snake had his tongue out, which is not the case in any of the papyri we have today. This forces us to question whether or not Cowdery was describing scenes that survive on papyri today or if he too was speaking of something that we no longer have. Benjamin Ashby Account, 1843 Benjamin Ashby is a secondhand account of the source of the Book of Abraham and also seems to indicate that the long roll, rather than the mounted fragments, was the original source. Ashby was a fifteen-year-old recent convert when he saw the papyri in November 1843, though he recorded the event many years later as he created an autobiography. He recalled, “One day with my mother and I visited his [Joseph Smith’s] house, he was not in, but we spent an interesting time with his mother. She exhibited the mummies from which the Book of Abraham was taken as well as the original papyrus on which it was written.”32 Ashby’s visit was after some papyri had been mounted and framed. It is not fully clear but it appears that his reference to “the original papyrus” refers to the long roll as the source, since he does not mention frames or slides as is typical when they were exhibited. Unnamed Observer  ccount, 1846 One man, whose written account is simply attributed to “M,” came through Nauvoo in 1846 and wrote about the time he was shown the mummies and papyri by Lucy Mack Smith,  aking him a secondhand witness regarding the source of the Book of Abraham. His account also described the long roll as the source and described vignettes that are not found on extant papyri. In addition, in accordance with other accounts, he reported that the Prophet could read parts of the inscription that had been destroyed. He recorded, “She produced a black looking roll (which she told us was papyrus) found upon the breast of the King, part of which the Prophet had unrolled and read; and she had pasted the deciphered sheets on the leaves of a book which she showed us.” 33 He further explained that “The roll was as dark as the bones of the Mummies, and bore very much the same appearance; but the opened sheets [presumably the mounted fragments] were exceedingly like thin parchment, and of quite a light color. There were birds, fishes, and fantastic looking people, interspersed amidst hyeroglyphics.” 34 After some discussion about their meaning, Lucy Mack Smith described something of Joseph Smith’s translation process, noting that “where the papyrus was torn, he could read the parts that were destroyed equally as well as those that were there.”35 From this account we learn that the Prophet had only unrolled and deciphered part of the roll. The fact that Lucy Mack Smith had a translation of what was on the scroll indicates that she thought the Book of Abraham came from that scroll, not the mounted fragments, though the account is not completely clear on this. Not only does the wording suggest this interpretation but such a reading accords with other accounts. It is not clear if the phrase “she had pasted the deciphered sheets on the leaves of a book” means that Mother Smith pasted the part of the papyri that had been deciphered into a book, or if it meant she had pasted the translation into a book. If it refers to sheets of papyrus, then at least part of what Joseph Smith had translated was no longer on the scroll but was also not among the framed slides, as it had been glued into a book. It seems far more likely that the phrase refers to the translation, since an earlier visitor had mentioned an “octavo” with Joseph Smith’s translation in it, from which Mother Smith read to those who came to view the mummies and papyri.36 We have no information as to the eventual fate of this octavo. Other things learned from this account are that the roll was quite distinguishable from the fragments due to its color and that some of the scenes the unknown observer saw on the fragments, if he recalled correctly, are no longer extant, since we have no depictions of fish. While this is a thirdhand account of the translation process, it is interesting to note that Mother Smith indicated that at least part of the translation process was revelation of a no-longer-existing text, rather than translation of a text in front of the Prophet. This idea is corroborated by another visitor who wrote that “these records were torn by being taken from the roll of embalming salve which contained them, and some parts entirely lost; but Smith is able to translate the whole by divine inspiration, and that which is lost, like Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, can be interpreted as well as that which is preserved.” 37 These statements suggest that we do not know to what degree the “translation” of the Book of Abraham came from the papyri as opposed to pure revelation. Jerusha Blanchard Account, 1852–1856 One of Hyrum Smith’s granddaughters, Jerusha Blanchard, recounted some of her  irlhood adventures during regular visits with her Aunt Emma and Great Grandmother Lucy Mack Smith and also indicated that the long roll was the source of the Book of Abraham, though it is a recollection made years later. Her visits, made between 1852 and 1856, frequently included playing hide-and-seek among the mummies. She recalled, some sixty-five years later, “In the arms of the Old King, lay the roll of papyrus from which our prophet translated the Book of Abraham.” 38 The account is firsthand regarding the papyri and secondhand regarding the source of the Book of Abraham. Joseph Smith III Account, 1898 One last account is worth examining. Joseph Smith III recollected years later things he had been told about the mummies, papyri, and records, indicating that the source of the Book of Abraham was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire. Some of his account is mistaken, such as his belief that it was William Smith who sold the papyri to the Woods Museum. His account is a late enough hearsay retelling with enough problems to demand a cautious use. Still, we must note that he describes the source of the Book of Abraham. He said, “The papyrus from which the Book of Abraham, was said to have been translated by Father, was with other portions found in a roll with some Egyptian mummies, pasted on either paper or linen and put into a small case of flat drawers, some dozen or sixteen in number.”39 Smith went on to say that this case contain- ing the papyri was sold to the Woods Museum and were destroyed. It is difficult to know what Smith meant when he said that the roll was pasted on either paper or linen and put in a case. It is possible that Smith was referring to the papyrus sheets that were pasted to paper and mounted under glass, some of which we know were kept in a kind of cabinet. If the “dozen or sixteen in number” refers to papyrus fragments, this interpretation is strengthened. Yet grammatically it seems more likely that the “dozen or sixteen” was referring to the number of drawers, though it is not completely clear. At the same time, many eyewitnesses referred to the papyri themselves as being made of linen or parchment, so this description is ambiguous. Additionally, while someone could describe the mounted fragments as being glued to paper, it seems very unlikely that anyone would describe them as being pasted to linen. Furthermore, Smith spoke of the contents of the cabinet being sold to the museum and burning. He claimed to have personally seen the mummies and cabinet of papyri in the museum before it burned. He must have been referring to papyri that no longer exists, presumably the scrolls. Thus, while the account is somewhat confusing, it indicates that Joseph Smith III considered the papyri that burned in the Great Chicago Fire to be the source of the Book of Abraham, not the papyri that remains. The language Smith uses, “Was said to have been translated,” suggests that he did not get this information from his father, but from others, making him a secondhand account regarding the source of the Book of Abraham. Having examined all the pertinent documents, we should also address the quality of the sources. While there are historiographic shortcomings in many, there are also some strengths. Notably, these accounts span the full length of time that Joseph Smith possessed the papyri in question. I have examined at least one account from most of the ten years Smith owned the papyri. While it would be preferable to have more firsthand accounts of what Joseph Smith said was the source of the Book of Abraham, we do have accounts from a variety of sources with a surprising amount of agreement between these disparate kinds of documents. While we do not have an account from Joseph Smith himself, we have a few firsthand accounts regarding what he said about the source and many more secondhand accounts, including those that are most specific about the source of the Book of Abraham. Thus, the conclusions drawn from the writings of Joseph Smith III, Haven, and Blanchard are not as strong as are historiographically ideal. Still they are our best historical sources and lend a strong weight to the way the sources that are slightly less clear should be interpreted. On the whole, it is an impressive collection of historical sources. The Book of Abraham’s Source Some eyewitnesses, namely Oliver Cowdery, Luman Shurtliff, and William I. Appleby, do not indicate anything one way or the other as to the source of the Book of Abraham, though they do provide valuable clues. The accounts of Henry Tressler, Benjamin Ashby, and “M” indicate that the long scroll was the source of that book, though it is possible to interpret them in other ways. Two of the accounts that are clear about the source of the Book of Abraham, Charlotte Haven and Jerusha Blanchard, both agree that it came from the long roll. Both of these are secondhand accounts. Joseph Smith III does not specify that the long roll was the source of the Book of Abraham but does indicate that it was papyrus that we no longer have. While not every account is fully clear, the united voice of the whole confirms that the long roll was the source of the Book of Abraham. This is the only scenario that can reconcile all the accounts.40 Actually, when all the accounts are taken together, it is more accurate to say that the aggregate of the sources dictates that the long roll is the source for Joseph Smith’s inspiration as he revealed the Book of Abraham. While the long roll is clearly involved, it is not clear if the “translation” was from the characters on the long roll or if the Prophet had the text revealed to him as he studied it, whether that writing was present on the scroll or not. Lucy Mack Smith’s avowals that her son could translate the text of the Book of Abraham whether or not it was on the papyrus suggests that the hieroglyphs may not have been as necessary to the translation as many have supposed.

Misconceptions Made Manifest In the end, while there are many more questions we must answer, our only historical evidence leads to the deduction that the few mounted fragments we now have are not the source of the Book of Abraham. Thus we must also conclude that those who used propinquity as their basis, and thus thought the text adjacent to the Sacrifice of Abraham Vignette was the source of the Book of Abraham, were doing so based on a false assumption and a faulty methodology. While there is much we still have to learn about the papyri, the source of the Book of Abraham, and the translation process, and while the eyewitness accounts do not answer many of these questions, they at least tell us what the source was not. These accounts demonstrate that the fragments we now have are not what the early Saints thought was the source of the Book of Abraham.
