## Background

Jeremiah was a member of the priestly household of Hilkiah. His hometown was Anathoth.

## Ministry

Preceeding his ministry, the Lord commanded Jeremiah not to get married and have children because of the empending doom that would fall upon Jerusalem. 

Jeremiah's ministry began in 626 bc, and ended sometime after 586 bc. His ministry was immediately preceded by that of Zephaniah.

Jeremiah had a few friends namely Ahikam, Gedaliag, Ebed-Melech, and most importantly, Baruch. Baruch was his scribe and accompanied Jeremiah on the long road to exile in Egypt. It is possible that Baruch was also responsible for the final compilation of the book of Jeremiah itself. 

Jeremiah began prophesying in Jodah halfway through the reign of Josiah. And continued to the reign of Zedekiah. It was a period of storm and stress when the doom of entire nations including Judah was close. 

> 11 Is this ahouse, which is called by my name, become a bden of crobbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, saith the Lord.
