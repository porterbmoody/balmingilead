# The Fall

Adam and Eve were the first humans to ever live on earth. They were placed in the garden of Eden. There were 2 trees in the garden of Eden, the tree of life and the tree of good and evil. 

# Adam and Eve

Adam and Eve were the first humans to ever live on the earth. God formed their bodies out of dust and placed them on the earth.

## Garden of Eden

After Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden, they were cast down to earth and fell and found themselves naked. So then the sewed fig leaves together and covered themselves. 

Genesis 2
> 7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.

Genesis 2
> 7 And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.

Genesis 3
> 21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.

## The Tree of Knowledge

There were 2 significant trees in the Garden of Eden. 1 was the tree of good and evil, the other was the tree of life. Adam and Eve were commanded not to partake of the fruit of the tree of good and evil. 

Moses 3 
> 16 And I, the Lord God, commanded the man, saying: Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat,
> 17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but, remember that I forbid it, for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.

Moses tells us that Adam and Eve were commanded not to partake of the tree of good and evil. If they do, they will "surely die". This teaches us they were commanded not to partake of the tree of good and evil, but they can partake of every other tree in the Garden of Eden.

Doctrine and Covenants 29

> 40 Wherefore, it came to pass that the devil tempted Adam, and he partook of the forbidden fruit and transgressed the commandment, wherein he became subject to the will of the devil, because he yielded unto temptation.
> 41 Wherefore, I, the Lord God, caused that he should be cast out from the Garden of Eden, from my presence, because of his transgression, wherein he became spiritually dead, which is the first death, even that same death which is the last death, which is spiritual, which shall be pronounced upon the wicked when I shall say: Depart, ye cursed.

We learn from the Doctrine and Covenants that the devil tempted Adam and Eve to break the commandment and partake of the fruit of the tree of good and evil. This caused them spiritual death and led to the fall where they were sent to earth. 

We also read in Moses 5

> 10 And in that day Adam blessed God and was filled, and began to prophesy concerning all the families of the earth, saying: Blessed be the name of God, for because of my transgression my eyes are opened, and in this life I shall have joy, and again in the flesh I shall see God.
Adam recognized certain blessings that could not have been realized without partaking of the fruit of the tree of good and evil and falling.

Ether 3:2

> for we know that thou art holy and dwellest in the heavens, and that we are unworthy before thee; because of the fall our natures have become evil continually;

The Brother of Jared tells us that because of the fall, we are unworthy before God. Our natures are naturally evil. 

Father Lehi taught that if the Fall had not taken place, Adam and Eve ‘would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery’ (2 Nephi 2:23). Without the experience of opposition in mortality, ‘all things must needs be a compound in one,’ in which there would be no happiness or misery.

It is clear that if Adam and Eve never decided to partake of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, the fall would never have happened and Adam and Eve would have remained in the Garden of Eden forever.

President Ezra Taft Benson said, "Just as a man does not desire food until he is hungry, so does he not desire the salvation of Christ until he knows why he needs Christ."
