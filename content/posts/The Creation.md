# The Creation

The creation is the 1st step in the 3 pillars of eternity, creation, fall, atonement. It is the first step in the Plan of Salvation. The Father organized the earth and all the living things therein through the son. This means Heavenly Father gave the plans and directions to Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ implemented them to create the earth, the plants, animals, and all other living things on the earth using already existing matter. This means Jesus Christ did not create any matter out of nothing. The creation took 6 days and on the 7th day, Jesus Christ rested. 

## Day 1

God formed the earth and the waters and made day and night.

Genesis 1
> 4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.

## Day 2

God formed the firmament

Genesis 1
> 6 Â¶ And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
