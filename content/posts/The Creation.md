# The Creation

Bruce R. McConkie said, “The Lord expects us to believe and understand the true doctrine of the Creation—the creation of this earth, of man, and of all forms of life”

The creation is the 1st step in the 3 pillars of eternity, creation, fall, atonement. It is the first step in the Plan of Salvation. The Father organized the earth and all the living things therein through the son. This means Heavenly Father gave the plans and directions to Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ implemented them to create the earth, the plants, animals, and all other living things on the earth using already existing matter. This means Jesus Christ did not create any matter out of nothing. The creation took 6 days and on the 7th day, Jesus Christ rested. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, basing its belief on divine revelation, ancient and modern, proclaims man to be the direct and lineal offspring of Deity. God Himself is an exalted man, perfected, enthroned, and supreme. By His almighty power He organized the earth, and all that it contains, from spirit and element, which exist co-eternally with Himself. He formed every plant that grows, and every animal that breathes, each after its own kind, spiritually and temporally—‘that which is spiritual being in the likeness of that which is temporal, and that which is temporal in the likeness of that which is spiritual.’ He made the tadpole and the ape, the lion and the elephant but He did not make them in His own image, nor endow them with Godlike reason and intelligence. Nevertheless, the whole animal creation will be perfected and perpetuated in the Hereafter, each class in its ‘distinct order or sphere,’ and will enjoy ‘eternal felicity.’ That fact has been made plain in this dispensation

## Day 1

God formed the earth and the waters and made day and night.

Genesis 1
> 4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.

## Day 2

God formed the firmament which is basically the atmosphere.

Genesis 1
> 6 ¶ And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.

## Day 3

God seperated the land from the seas and oceans. 

Genesis 1
> 9 ¶ And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.

God also added grass, herbs, and fruit trees to the earth. 

Genesis 1
> 11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind

## Day 4

God also set the sun and the moon in place. The sun to make the earth bright in the day, the moon to make the earth bright in the night.

Genesis 1
> 16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.

So in the fourth day, God separated the day from the night on the earth. 

## Day 5

Genesis 1
> 21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

On day 5, God created whales and birds. God also allowed them to multiply and reproduce.

## Day 6

Genesis 1
> 24 ¶ And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.

God created all the living creatures upon the earth, cattle, bugs, insects, and beasts so cows, oxen, buffalo.

Genesis 1
> 26 ¶ And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness

God also created man on this day after the likeness of God. So many has a body similar to God's.

Genesis 2
> 1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.

God finished the created on the 6th day. 

## Day 7

On this day God rested.

Genesis 2
> 3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
