The Land of Jerusalem:
The Place of Jesus' Birth
Robert F. Smith
Alma 7:10 “He shall be born of Mary, at Jerusalem which isthe land of our forefathers.”
It has been alleged that the Book of Mormon commits a foolish error by predicting that Jesus would be born “at
Jerusalem.” But just as Rome was urbs et orbis, “city and world,” so Jerusalem was not simply a city, not even just a
city-state. It is and was a symbol of Zion. It typied all that which the exiles in Babylonia had lost (see Psalms
137:5-6), and, in ourtime, it is the focus of the return of other exiles from their nearly two millennia of dispersion.
Every synagogue faces Jerusalem—the Holy City and City of David. In several ways,recent scholarship strongly
conrms and elaborates upon the excellent older studies by professors Sperry and Nibley answering the critics on
how Jerusalem could be called the place of Jesus’ birth.

With the rise of the classical Israelite state, the role of the hereditary tribes declined, and the monarchy imposed
administrative districts upon the nation: twelve in the North, and twelve in the South. The delineation of these
districts is available in the Bible (see Joshua 15:20-63 [Septuagint]; 1 Kings 4:7-19), and Bethlehem was included
in the district of Jerusalem.
2
In the same way that the “land” or district of Jerusalem was administratively distinguished from the city of
Jerusalem, so, according to Kenneth Kitchen, the great city of Hazor(Tell el-Qeda) was distinguished from the
state of Hazor. Thus, Abraham had dwelt or“sojourned” in the territory of Gerar,ratherthan in the city itself (Tell
Abu Hureira; Genesis 20:1). The “city and state often have the same name in the Ancient Orient, although distinct
entities. This applied to Carchemish in Hittite politics, for example, where city and land (same name) had distinct
roles.”
3 Indeed, the land of Jerusalem ultimately extended far beyond mere district borders during its phase as a
Latin kingdom, covering about 500 to 550 square kilometers.
4
Thus it is quite apparent that Jerusalem “did double duty as the royal and the district capital.”
5 As early as
Canaanite times, Jerusalem held royal status, and it was termed mat URU sa-lim (“land of Jerusalem”) in the
Amarna Letters.
6
Where then was Jesus born? Truly, in Bethlehem of the land of Judaea (see Micah 5:2; Matthew 2:1-6; Luke 2:4)—
any child could tell you that in Joseph Smith’s time as well as in ours. What no one in modern times would have
known for sure (before the 1887 discovery of the Tell El-Amarna Tablets) was that Bethlehem was also part of an
area anciently called the land of Jerusalem.

Only once in the King James Bible is the term land of Jerusalem even remotely recognizable, and then within a
parallel phrase: “And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land” (2
Samuel 5:6). This verse is obviously insufcient to suggest to Joseph Smith how “lands” were constituted in Old
Testament times. Yet the Book of Mormon twice refers to a “land of Jerusalem” in which Jesus was to be born
(Alma 7:10; Helaman 16:19). This is consistent with the broader pattern of toponymy that appears in the Book of
Mormon (i.e., the lands and cities of Nephi and Zarahemla).
It is apparent now that the Book of Mormon’s casual statements about the “land of Jerusalem” are in full
agreement with whatrecent scholarship tells us about the geography of ancient Judaea.
