## Nahom

Nahom is the city in the middle east where Ishmael was buried after he died. 

[Warren Aston](www.lehistrail.com) notes,

“The recent discovery by a German archaeological team of a stone altar in Yemen referring to the tribal name NIHM was announced in the Journal of Book of Mormon Studies in 1999.(1) Perfectly preserved under centuries of sand, the altar had been dated by its excavators to about 600-700 BC, thus placing it squarely in the time frame of the Book of Mormon ‘Nahom’ (1 Nephi 16:34) where Ishmael was buried. Unlike most places mentioned in the account of the journey from Jerusalem, Nephi’s wording makes it clear that Nahom was already called such by the local population.”

So it is clear that we have discovered an alter with the characters, "NHM". 

1 Nephi 16:34 says

> 34 And it came to pass that Ishmael died, and was buried in the place which was called Nahom.

Which is a crystal clear reference to the place, Nahom. According to Hebrew "nahom" likely means 

> “consolation,” from verb naham, “be sorry, console oneself.”

Which sounds like it means something related to consolation which is what Lehi's family felt when Ishmael died. 

## Mesoamerican Model

Presented in [John Sorenson's Article](https://archive.bookofmormoncentral.org/sites/default/files/archive-files/pdf/sorenson/2024-04-18/john_l._sorenson_mormons_map_2000.pdf)

The Mesoamerican model is basically the proposition that the Book of Mormon events occured in or near central america including, but not limited to Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras.

3. Correspondence with Book of Mormon geography: Proponents of the model argue that the geography described in the Book of Mormon matches the Mesoamerican region, including features like rivers, mountains, and valleys.

Key locations in the Mesoamerican Model:

### Book of Mormon references:

The river Sidon is mentioned in Alma 2:15.

> 15 And it came to pass that the Amlicites came upon the hill Amnihu, which was east of the river Sidon, which ran by the land of Zarahemla, and there they began to make war with the Nephites.

Proposed locations for the river Sidon:

- Magdalena River in modern Colombia
- Usumacinta River
- Grijalva River

The Valley of Nephi:
- Wadi Tayyib al-Ism, a river valley in northwest Arabia

## Hill Cumorah

Mormon 6:6 And it came to pass that when we had gathered in all our people in one to the land of Cumorah, behold I, Mormon, began to be old; and knowing it to be the last struggle of my people, and having been commanded of the Lord that I should not suffer the records which had been handed down by our fathers, which were sacred, to fall into the hands of the Lamanites, (for the Lamanites would destroy them) therefore I made this record out of the plates of Nephi, and hid up in the hill Cumorah all the records which had been entrusted to me by the hand of the Lord, save it were these few plates which I gave unto my son Moroni.
