I am deeply grateful to be here with you today. I live in New River, just north of Anthem I am blessed to live in a beautiful place. I also express gratitude to be a member of the deer valley ward with great members and leaders. I am eager to share a special message with you that I have prepared. 

In *2 Nephi 31:3* Nephi said,

> 3 For my soul delighteth in plainness; for after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of men. For the Lord God giveth light unto the understanding; for he speaketh unto men according to their language, unto their understanding.

Like Nephi, I wish to speak in plainness, according to your language and unto your understanding.

Today I would like to share a very simple, but important message. God, our Heavenly Father loves us more than we can fully comprehend. His love is perfect, infinite, enduring, and universal. Because of that love, He has given us the gospel—a plan that allows us to repent and become like Jesus Christ and return to them and live with them forever. In every dispensation, Heavenly Father reaches out to His children, calling prophets to teach His gospel to the people.

As it says in *Amos 3:7 JST*:

> 7 Surely the Lord God will do nothing, until he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

From the beginning, God has called prophets to teach His children. Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, served as prophets to teach Heavenly Father's gospel. In the meridian of time, Heavenly Father sent his son, Jesus Christ to earth to teach the gospel. He also did many other things. He performed miracles, ordained apostles and established his church. He taught truth and wisdom. He set the example for us. He lived an entire life with man and then performed the infinite atonement and suffered and died for our sins. 

2 Nephi 10:3 teaches that he was crucified saying, 

3 Wherefore, as I said unto you, it must needs be expedient that Christ—for in the last night the angel spake unto me that this should be his name—should come among the Jews, among those who are the more wicked part of the world; and they shall crucify him.

After Heavenly Father's son, Jesus Christ died, the apostles continued to preach the gospel for a time, but eventually due to wickedness, the church fell away and the doctrines and ordinances were changed or corrupted. 

Isaiah 24:5 says,

> 5 The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.

We learn that men heeded the adversary and corrupted the doctrine that Jesus Christ taught in his mortal ministry. 

In around 53-57AD, Paul taught that grievous wolves would enter in among the church *Acts 20:29-30*

> 29 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.

> 30 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.

2 Thessalonians 2

> 3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;

For hundreds of years, the earth the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the priesthood power did not exist on the earth.

Fast forward many hundreds of years, in 1820, a young boy named Joseph Smith noticed this, saying,

> "At about the age of twelve years, my mind become seriously impressed with regard to the all-important concerns for the welfare of my immortal soul, which led me to searching the scriptures—believing, as I was taught, that they contained the word of God and thus applying myself to them. My intimate acquaintance with those of different denominations led me to marvel exceedingly, for I discovered that they did not adorn their profession by a holy walk and godly conversation agreeable to what I found contained in that sacred depository. This was a grief to my soul. I found that mankind did not come unto the Lord but that they had apostatized from the true and living faith, and there was no society or denomination that was built upon the gospel of Jesus Christ as recorded in the New Testament. I felt to mourn for my own sins and for the sins of the world, for I learned in the scriptures that God was the same yesterday, today, and forever, that he was no respecter of persons, for he was God."

Joseph recognized that the true Church of Jesus Christ had fallen away. But how could this be? Heavenly Father never promised he would never forget his children, right?

2 Nephi 29:14 reminds us that the Lord has covenanted with Abraham and would remember his seed forever.

> 14 And it shall come to pass that my people, which are of the house of Israel, shall be gathered home unto the lands of their possessions; and my word also shall be gathered in one. And I will show unto them that fight against my word and against my people, who are of the house of Israel, that I am God, and that I covenanted with Abraham that I would remember his seed forever.

Isaiah 49:15-16 reminds us that the Lord would remember his child even if his very own mother forgets him.

> 15 Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.

> 16 Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.

He began to search for answers. He read in James 1:5 which says,

> 5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.

Joseph followed the counsel of James and went into a grove of trees and began to pray. The young boy of only 14 years old soon had a marvelous revelation. After going on his own to pray and "ask of God" for wisdom, a pillar of light descendent over his head and 2 personages appeared. Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ appeared and told Joseph Smith that none of the churches were true and that

> "Joseph, my son, thy sins are forgiven thee. Go thy way, walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments. Behold, I am the Lord of glory. I was crucified for the world, that all those who believe on my name may have eternal life. Behold, the world lieth in sin at this time, and none doeth good, no, not one. They have turned aside from the gospel and keep not my commandments. They draw near to me with their lips while their hearts are far from me. And mine anger is kindling against the inhabitants of the earth, to visit them according to their ungodliness and to bring to pass that which hath been spoken by the mouth of the prophets and apostles. Behold and lo, I come quickly, as it is written of me, in the cloud, clothed in the glory of my Father."

And thus we see that Heavenly Father has not forgotten his children. 



<!-- > 15 After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction. -->

<!-- > 16 But, exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into despair and abandon myself to destruction—not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had such marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being—just at this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me. -->

<!-- One of the things that Heavenly Father told Joseph Smith to do was translate the Book of Mormon from the gold plates that had been put into the earth hundreds of years ago by the Prophet Moroni. Joseph Smith then translated the gold plates, and now we have the Book of Mormon. The Book of Mormon teaches the fulness of the gospel that Jesus Christ taught while he was on the earth.  -->

<!-- In His infinite mercy, our Heavenly Father prepared the way for the gospel to be restored in its fullness. This restoration began with a young man named Joseph Smith. Through Joseph Smith, the Lord restored His Church, the priesthood, and the plain and precious truths of the gospel. Joseph Smith served as an instrument in the Lord’s hands, and through him, the heavens were opened once more. -->

<!-- *The Power of Modern Revelation* -->

<!-- We have received many powerful revelations by the pen of Joseph Smith, but one of the greatest is a book called the Book of Mormon.  -->
<!-- Today, we are blessed to live in a time when the gospel has been restored in its fullness. We have the scriptures, including the Book of Mormon, which stands as another testament of Jesus Christ. We have the priesthood keys and ordinances necessary for salvation. And most importantly, we have living prophets and apostles who continue to receive revelation for our time. -->

<!-- The truths revealed through Joseph Smith are simple yet profound. They teach us about the nature of God, the plan of salvation, and the importance of faith, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. These truths are not new—they are the same eternal principles taught by prophets since the days of Adam. But they have been restored to bless us in our day. -->

<!-- *A Testimony of God’s Love* -->

<!-- Brothers and sisters, I testify that God lives. He is our loving Heavenly Father, and He knows each of us personally. He has given us the gospel to guide us, prophets to lead us, and His Son, Jesus Christ, to save us. The restoration of the gospel is evidence of His perfect love for all His children. -->
