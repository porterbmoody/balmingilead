*Brothers and Sisters*,

I am grateful to be with you today. I live in New River, just north of Anthem I am blessed to live in a beautiful place. I also express gratitude to be a member of the deer valley ward with great members and leaders. I also thank the stake members and leaders for the selfless service. I have been greatly blessed to attend the activites in the stake here. Brothers and Sisters, I am eager to share a special message that I have prepared. 

In *2 Nephi 31:3* Nephi said,

> 3 For my soul delighteth in plainness; for after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of men. For the Lord God giveth light unto the understanding; for he speaketh unto men according to their language, unto their understanding.

Like Nephi, I wish to speak in plainness, according to your language and unto your understanding.

Today I would like to share a very simple message. God, our Heavenly Father loves us more than we can comprehend. His love is perfect, infinite, enduring, and universal. Because of that love, He has given us the gospel—a plan that allows us to repent and become like Him and live with Him forever. In every dispensation, Heavenly Father calls prophets to teach His gospel.

*Amos 3:7 JST* says,

> 7 Surely the Lord God will do nothing, until he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, and Moses, all served as prophets to teach Heavenly Father's gospel. In the meridian of time, Heavenly Father sent his son, Jesus Christ to earth to teach the gospel. Jesus Christ also did many other things. He performed miracles, ordained apostles and established his church. He taught his doctrine. He set the example for us. He lived an entire life with man and then performed the infinite atonement and suffered and died for our sins. 
2 Nephi 10:3 says,

> 3 Wherefore, it must needs be expedient that Christ should come among the Jews, among those who are the more wicked part of the world; and they shall crucify him.

After, Jesus Christ was crucified, the apostles continued to preach the gospel for a time, but eventually due to wickedness, the church fell away into apostasy. Isaiah 24:5 teaches,

> 5 The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.

We learn that men heeded the adversary and corrupted the doctrine that Jesus Christ taught in his mortal ministry. 

In around 53-57AD, Paul taught that grievous wolves would enter in among the church *Acts 20:29-30*

> 29 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.

> 30 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.

2 Thessalonians 2:3 teaches us that there will be a "falling away" of the true church before the 2nd coming of Jesus Christ.

> 3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;

For hundreds of years, the earth the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the priesthood power did not exist on the earth.

Fast forward many hundreds of years, in 1820, a young boy named Joseph Smith noticed this, saying,

> "At about the age of twelve years, my mind become seriously impressed with regard to the all-important concerns for the welfare of my immortal soul, which led me to searching the scriptures—believing, as I was taught, that they contained the word of God and thus applying myself to them. My intimate acquaintance with those of different denominations led me to marvel exceedingly, for I discovered that they did not adorn their profession by a holy walk and godly conversation agreeable to what I found contained in that sacred depository. This was a grief to my soul. I found that mankind did not come unto the Lord but that they had apostatized from the true and living faith, and there was no society or denomination that was built upon the gospel of Jesus Christ as recorded in the New Testament. I felt to mourn for my own sins and for the sins of the world, for I learned in the scriptures that God was the same yesterday, today, and forever, that he was no respecter of persons, for he was God."

Joseph recognized that the true Church of Jesus Christ had fallen away. But how could this be? Heavenly Father promised he would never forget his children, right? 2 Nephi 29:14 reminds us that the Lord has covenanted with Abraham and would remember his seed forever.

> 14 And it shall come to pass that my people, which are of the house of Israel, shall be gathered home unto the lands of their possessions; and my word also shall be gathered in one. And I will show unto them that fight against my word and against my people, who are of the house of Israel, that I am God, and that I covenanted with Abraham that I would remember his seed forever.

So we see that God covenanted with Abraham, and would remember his seed forever. We also read in Isaiah 49:15-16 that the Lord would remember his child even if his very own mother forgets him.

> 15 Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.

> 16 Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.

And so we see that the Lord would remember his child even if his very own mother forgets him. We also read in Malachi 3:6 that the Lord does not change.

> 6 For I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.

> 7 ¶ Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the Lord of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?

This teaches that if we have ever gone away from the ordinances of Christ, we are able to return and Christ will likewise return unto us.

And we also read that God doesn't change in the slightest degree of variance in the Doctrine and Covenants 3

> 2 For God doth not walk in crooked paths, neither doth he turn to the right hand nor to the left, neither doth he vary from that which he hath said, therefore his paths are straight, and his course is one eternal round.

So Joseph Smith began to search for answers. He went into a grove of trees to pray. On that beautiful Spring morning, a pillar of light descendent over his head and 2 personages appeared. Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ appeared and said,

> "Joseph, my son, thy sins are forgiven thee. Go thy way, walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments. Behold, I am the Lord of glory. I was crucified for the world, that all those who believe on my name may have eternal life. Behold, the world lieth in sin at this time, and none doeth good, no, not one. They have turned aside from the gospel and keep not my commandments. They draw near to me with their lips while their hearts are far from me. And mine anger is kindling against the inhabitants of the earth, to visit them according to their ungodliness and to bring to pass that which hath been spoken by the mouth of the prophets and apostles. Behold and lo, I come quickly, as it is written of me, in the cloud, clothed in the glory of my Father."

After this vision, the Lord proceeded to reveal an ancient text called the Book of Mormon which contains the following verse in 1 Nephi 13:34,

> 34 And it came to pass that the angel of the Lord spake unto me, saying: Behold, saith the Lamb of God, after I have visited the remnant of the house of Israel—and this remnant of whom I speak is the seed of thy father—wherefore, after I have visited them in judgment, and smitten them by the hand of the Gentiles, and after the Gentiles do stumble exceedingly, because of the most plain and precious parts of the gospel of the Lamb which have been kept back by that abominable church, which is the mother of harlots, saith the Lamb—I will be merciful unto the Gentiles in that day, insomuch that I will bring forth unto them, in mine own power, much of my gospel, which shall be plain and precious, saith the Lamb.

So this is a prophecy saying that the great and abominable church held back many plain and precious truths and that the Lord will bring forth much of his gospel unto the Gentiles in our day. 

1 Nephi 15

> 13 And now, the thing which our father meaneth concerning the grafting in of the natural branches through the fulness of the Gentiles, is, that in the latter days, when our seed shall have dwindled in unbelief, yea, for the space of many years, and many generations after the Messiah shall be manifested in body unto the children of men, then shall the fulness of the gospel of the Messiah come unto the Gentiles, and from the Gentiles unto the remnant of our seed

2 Nephi 10

> 2 For behold, the promises which we have obtained are promises unto us according to the flesh; wherefore, as it has been shown unto me that many of our children shall perish in the flesh because of unbelief, nevertheless, God will be merciful unto many; and our children shall be restored, that they may come to that which will give them the true knowledge of their Redeemer.

And so we see that our infinitely loving Heavenly Father has not forgotten his children. He has again revealed to all the children of men that Jesus Christ came to earth to atone for the sins of all men, that those who believe on His name will have eternal life. Through Joseph Smith, the Lord restored His Church, priesthood, and the plain and precious truths of the gospel. I am grateful for the infinite love and mercy of God for sending his son, Jesus Christ to atone for our sins, and restore the truth and light of the gospel once again in our day. I also testify that President Nelson and the apostles are true apostles of the Lord. The words of President Nelson are true that, "no matter what questions or problems we have, the answer is always found in the life and teachings of Jesus Christ." I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
