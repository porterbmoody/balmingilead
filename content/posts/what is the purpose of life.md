# Purpose of life

This question has been debated for so long, and I don't think anyone has really gotten to the bottom of it. But over the course of my life I've found a few worthwhile things. 

## Take on Responsibility

Humans are built to take on challenges. And to take on responsibility. 


## Learning

In order to be able to speak effectively, you have to know what you're talking about 

Life is basically a big open slate, we can do just about anything we are really determined to do. 

Jordan Peterson said, 
"The fact that you're full of faults doesn't mean you have to stop, and it doesn't mean you can't learn. If the actual ideal isn't conceptualized perfectly thats ok. It just matters that you do it and move forward."



## Life is Suffering

The bhuddists say, "Life is Suffering"
So if life is suffering, why should we continue with it?
