## Commandment of Polygamy

According to Mary Elizabeth Rollins Lightner, an angel was required to visit Joseph three times between 1834 and 1842 before he fully complied:

An angel came to him [Joseph Smith] and the last time he came with a drawn sword in his hand and told Joseph if he did not go into that principle, he would slay him. Joseph said he talked to him soberly about it, and told him it was an abomination and quoted scripture to him. He said in the Book of Mormon it was an abomination in the eyes of the Lord, and they were to adhere to these things except the Lord speak. â€¦ [The Prophet reported that] the angel came to me three times between the years of 1834 and 1842 and said I was to obey that principle or he would slay me

So an angel appeared to Joseph Smith with a sword threatening to kill him if he did not practice polygamy. The angel also quoted the Book of Mormon, saying it was sometimes permitted for polygamy to be practiced. 

Jacob 2:30 reads

> 30 For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things.

This means God commands us to practice monogamy, 1 wife and 1 husband unless the Lord will "raise up seed unto me". What does "raise up seed" mean?" An initial thought might be that it means to reproduce and give birth to children within the church to increase the number of church members. 

Doctrine and Covenants 132 is a response from God about polygamy. God basically outlines the law, principle, and doctrine of polygamy. 

Doctrine and Covenants 132

> 4 For behold, I reveal unto you a new and an everlasting covenant; and if ye abide not that covenant, then are ye damned; for no one can reject this covenant and be permitted to enter into my glory.

The word destroy or destroyed is used 11 times in the section:

> 14 For whatsoever things remain are by me; and whatsoever things are not by me shall be shaken and destroyed.

> 26 Verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man marry a wife according to my word, and they are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, according to mine appointment, and he or she shall commit any sin or transgression of the new and everlasting covenant whatever, and all manner of blasphemies, and if they commit no murder wherein they shed innocent blood, yet they shall come forth in the first resurrection, and enter into their exaltation; but they shall be destroyed in the flesh, and shall be delivered unto the buffetings of Satan unto the day of redemption, saith the Lord God.

> 41 And as ye have asked concerning adultery, verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man receiveth a wife in the new and everlasting covenant, and if she be with another man, and I have not appointed unto her by the holy anointing, she hath committed adultery and shall be destroyed.

> 52 And let mine handmaid, Emma Smith, receive all those that have been given unto my servant Joseph, and who are virtuous and pure before me; and those who are not pure, and have said they were pure, shall be destroyed, saith the Lord God.

> 54 And I command mine handmaid, Emma Smith, to abide and cleave unto my servant Joseph, and to none else. But if she will not abide this commandment she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord; for I am the Lord thy God, and will destroy her if she abide not in my law.

> 57 And again, I say, let not my servant Joseph put his property out of his hands, lest an enemy come and destroy him; for Satan seeketh to destroy; for I am the Lord thy God, and he is my servant; and behold, and lo, I am with him, as I was with Abraham, thy father, even unto his exaltation and glory.

> 63 But if one or either of the ten virgins, after she is espoused, shall be with another man, she has committed adultery, and shall be destroyed; for they are given unto him to multiply and replenish the earth, according to my commandment, and to fulfil the promise which was given by my Father before the foundation of the world, and for their exaltation in the eternal worlds, that they may bear the souls of men; for herein is the work of my Father continued, that he may be glorified.

> 64 And again, verily, verily, I say unto you, if any man have a wife, who holds the keys of this power, and he teaches unto her the law of my priesthood, as pertaining to these things, then shall she believe and administer unto him, or she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord your God; for I will destroy her; for I will magnify my name upon all those who receive and abide in my law.



## The Implementation of Polygamy

Jacob 2 talks about the topic of polygamy and what is according to the commandments and what is not. We also read in verse 24 that it was an abomination that David and Solomon had many wives and concubines. We also read in Doctrine and Covenants that teh many wives and concubines David and Solomon had were not a sin. This may seem like a contradiction upon first impression, but a closer analysis reveals that David and Solomon did not sin, except for the things they did not receive of God. 

Jacob 2
> 24 Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord.

Doctrine and Covenants 132
> 38 David also received many wives and concubines, and also Solomon and Moses my servants, as also many others of my servants, from the beginning of creation until this time; and in nothing did they sin save in those things which they received not of me.
