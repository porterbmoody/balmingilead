## Commandment of Polygamy

According to Mary Elizabeth Rollins Lightner, an angel was required to visit Joseph three times between 1834 and 1842 before he fully complied:

An angel came to him [Joseph Smith] and the last time he came with a drawn sword in his hand and told Joseph if he did not go into that principle, he would slay him. Joseph said he talked to him soberly about it, and told him it was an abomination and quoted scripture to him. He said in the Book of Mormon it was an abomination in the eyes of the Lord, and they were to adhere to these things except the Lord speak. â€¦ [The Prophet reported that] the angel came to me three times between the years of 1834 and 1842 and said I was to obey that principle or he would slay me

So an angel appeared to Joseph Smith with a sword threatening to kill him if he did not practice polygamy. 

## The Implementation of Polygamy

Jacob 2 talks about the topic of polygamy and what is according to the commandments and what is not. We also read in verse 24 that it was an abomination that David and Solomon had many wives and concubines. We also read in Doctrine and Covenants that teh many wives and concubines David and Solomon had were not a sin. This may seem like a contradiction upon first impression, but a closer analysis reveals that David and Solomon did not sin, except for the things they did not receive of God. 

Jacob 2:24 Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord.

Doctrine and Covenants 132:38 David also received many wives and concubines, and also Solomon and Moses my servants, as also many others of my servants, from the beginning of creation until this time; and in nothing did they sin save in those things which they received not of me.
