# There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world

> 20 There is a law, irrevocably decreed in bheaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicatedâ€”
21 And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.
> D&C 130

When this verse was revealed, Joseph Smith was asking Jesus Christ questions.
