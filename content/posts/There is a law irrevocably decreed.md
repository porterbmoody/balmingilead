# There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world

> 20 There is a law, irrevocably decreed in bheaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicatedâ€”
21 And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.
> D&C 130

When this verse was revealed, Joseph Smith was asking Jesus Christ questions. A very intruiging verse to say the least. It means the blessings we receive in life are contingent upon our obedience to God's laws. It means when we receive any blessing from God, it is because we were obedient to the law that blessing was predicated upon.

There are lots of real world examples it is difficult to see how this verse applies. In fact, we will not know exactly who obeyed what law until judgement day. It is also true that anyone who endures to the end will be made perfect and become perfect through the mercy and merits of the atonement of Jesus Christ. Therefore anyone who endures to the end, in this life and in the next will recieve all the blessings available.
