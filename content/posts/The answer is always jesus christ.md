*Brothers and Sisters,*

I am deeply grateful to be here with you today. I live in New River, just north of Anthem I am blessed to live in a beautiful place. I also express gratitude to be a member of the deer valley ward with great members and leadrs. I am eager to share a special message with you that I have prepared. 

In *2 Nephi 31:3* Nephi said,

> 3 For my soul delighteth in plainness; for after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of men. For the Lord God giveth light unto the understanding; for he speaketh unto men according to their language, unto their understanding.

Like Nephi, I wish to speak in plainness, according to your language and unto your understanding.

*God’s Love and the Plan of Salvation*

Our Heavenly Father loves us more than we can fully comprehend. His love is perfect, infinite, and enduring. Because of that love, He has given us the gospel—a divine roadmap to help us return to Him and experience eternal joy. In every dispensation of time, God has reached out to His children, calling prophets to teach His gospel to the people.

As it says in *Amos 3:7 Joseph Smith Translation*:

> 7 Surely the Lord God will do nothing, until he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

From the beginning, God has called prophets to teach His children. Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and many others were chosen to declare His word. In the meridian of time, Jesus Christ Himself came to earth as the greatest Prophet, Teacher, and Savior. He taught the fullness of the gospel, performed miracles, and ultimately gave His life to atone for our sins.

*The Great Apostasy and the Restoration*

After the Savior’s mortal ministry, many of His teachings were corrupted or lost. The priesthood authority was taken from the earth, and the world entered a period known as the Great Apostasy. For centuries, people lived without the fullness of the gospel or the guidance of living prophets. Yet, even in that darkness, God’s love for His children never wavered.

In His infinite mercy, our Heavenly Father prepared the way for the gospel to be restored in its fullness. This restoration began with a young man named Joseph Smith. Through Joseph Smith, the Lord restored His Church, the priesthood, and the plain and precious truths of the gospel. Joseph Smith served as an instrument in the Lord’s hands, and through him, the heavens were opened once more.

*The Power of Modern Revelation*

We have received many powerful revelations by the pen of Joseph Smith, but one of the greatest is a book called the Book of Mormon. 
Today, we are blessed to live in a time when the gospel has been restored in its fullness. We have the scriptures, including the Book of Mormon, which stands as another testament of Jesus Christ. We have the priesthood keys and ordinances necessary for salvation. And most importantly, we have living prophets and apostles who continue to receive revelation for our time.

The truths revealed through Joseph Smith are simple yet profound. They teach us about the nature of God, the plan of salvation, and the importance of faith, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. These truths are not new—they are the same eternal principles taught by prophets since the days of Adam. But they have been restored to bless us in our day.

*A Testimony of God’s Love*

Brothers and sisters, I testify that God lives. He is our loving Heavenly Father, and He knows each of us personally. He has given us the gospel to guide us, prophets to lead us, and His Son, Jesus Christ, to save us. The restoration of the gospel is evidence of His perfect love for all His children.

I invite each of us to study the scriptures, listen to the words of our living prophets, and seek personal revelation. As we do so, we will come to know for ourselves that these truths are eternal and that they have the power to transform our lives.

I leave these thoughts with you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
