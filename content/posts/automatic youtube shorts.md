# Automatic Youtube Shorts

I would like it to be able to 
- give it a prompt like “make a video about 3 important business techniques” 
- an LLM would create a script -> 
- create a set of images to go with that script (or maybe a video but that’s probably more advanced) 
- add the script on top of the video at the correct time stamps 
- add text to speech on top of the video

In today's video, we’ll cover 3 important business techniques to boost your growth. 
First, "Focus on Customer Experience". Prioritize customer satisfaction to create loyal clients. 
Second, "Leverage Technology". Use data analytics and automation to optimize your operations.
Third, "Network and Build Relationships". Partnering with other businesses can help you expand.
These are three powerful techniques to grow any business.
