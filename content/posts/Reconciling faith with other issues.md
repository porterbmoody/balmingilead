If anyone is wrestling with church history or other church topics, this is the right place to find some answers. There are general principles that apply to people who wrestle with faith struggles, and general way to overcome them. I personally have had times where I wrestle with maintaining faith along with learning new information that might at first seem contradictory to my original faith. 

The following is a list of issues that I have become aware of that have possibly caused many members to struggle with their faith:
- Joseph Smith and polygamy, Brigham Young and polygamy, Wilford Woodruff and polygamy
- The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints methods of handling the tithing funds and investments
- church finances, Ensign Peak Advisors reports to the SEC
- Joseph Smith translations of the Book of Mormon
- the kinderhook plates
- contradictions between the Bible and the Book of Mormon
- discrepancies between the Egyptian papyri and the book of Abraham
- Book of Mormon historicity
- Book of Mormon geographical evidence or lack thereof
- Book of Mormon anachronisms
- racial priesthood restrictions and the fact that blacks could not receive the priesthood until 1987
- reconciling evolution with Adam and Eve
- reconciling scientific accounts of the creation of earth and the emergence of life itself and the creation account recorded in Genesis or Abraham
- reconciling Luke 23:43 (And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.) with spirit paradise and protestant views
- reconciling Revelations 22:18–19 “And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.” with the Book of Mormon being another text to the Bible.
- the change in the introduction in of the Book of Mormon in 2006 from
“After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites, and they are the principal ancestors of the American Indians.”
 To
“After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites, and they are among the ancestors of the American Indians.”
I would love to talk with you about any of these topics because I love studying them and diving deeper into them. 
But I would also invite you to take your questions to the Lord and ask him in sincere prayer because I know he “give the wisdom to all men liberally” as we read from James (James 1:5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.)
I have a testimony that Joseph Smith saw God the Father and Jesus Christ in the sacred grove, and translated the Book of Mormon by the power of God after multiple meetings with the angel Moroni. I also have a testimony that Adam and Eve were placed in the garden and partook of the fruit of the tree of good and evil.


## Counsel from James

While Joseph Smith was just 14 years old he was wondering which church was true. He read in the epistle of James:

James 1:5
> 5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
> 6 But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.

This tells us that we can ask God to obtain wisdom, but verse 6 reminds us that we must ask in faith, dothing waivering, nothing doubting. He that wavereth is like "a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed".

After Joseph Smith read this verse, we acted in faith and went to a grove of trees and prayed to know which church was true. Immediately, a dark power, the power of Satan ceased upon him and tried to stop him from continuing the prayer. But as he endured, he continued to pray and eventually Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ appeared to him.
