Job 42
5 I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.
Job saw God with his physical eyes proving God has a physical body of flesh and bones just as we learn from Doctrine and Covenants.

In August 2025, Phoenix home prices were down 1.1% compared to last year, selling for a median price of $445K. On average, homes in Phoenix sell after 64 days on the market compared to 52 days last year. There were 1,271 homes sold in August this year, up from 1,182 last year.

Elder Woodruff’s second mission to the Fox Islands seems to have been filled with greater opposition, antagonism, and persecution than his first. He would later write that nearly all residents on the islands who had attended his meetings had taken sides, for or against his message.[75] On Christmas Day, Elder Woodruff preached in the Deep Hollow schoolhouse to a large congregation. His journal entry on that occasion reads: “My soul was vex’d with the wicked procedings of Mr Towl a school teacher in rejecting my testimony.”[76] Three days later he engaged in a conversation with Mr. Douglass, the Methodist priest, who requested that Wilford “work miracles to make him believe” and railed against him.[77] Wilford told Douglass that he was “a wicked and adulterous man, and predicted that the curse of God would rest upon him, and that his wickedness would be made manifest in the eyes of the people.” Reflecting years later, Woodruff wrote: “While visiting these Islands several years afterwards I learned that the prediction had really been fulfilled, and that he [Douglass] was serving out a fourteen years’ term of imprisonment for a beastly crime.”[78] He closed his journal for the year 1837 by declaring: “The solemnities of Eternity is resting upon the People. The word of God is like a sharp two edged sword in the hearts of men. I am now Preaching & Baptizing almost daily. O may the Lord roll on his work amid the Islands of the sea and give me a rich harvest of Souls.”

Helaman 6
3 And thus we see that except the Lord doth chasten his people with many afflictions, yea, except he doth visit them with death and with terror, and with famine and with all manner of pestilence, they will not remember him.
4 O how foolish⁠, and how vain, and how evil, and devilish, and how quick to do iniquity, and how slow to do good, are the children of men; yea, how quick to hearken unto the words of the evil one, and to set their hearts upon the vain things of the world!

Number 15
23 And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.
24 The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.
In Number 13, Moses sent 12 spies to scout the land of Canaan. They found a cluster of grapes, put it on a pole and had 2 people carry the pole because it was heavy and brought it back to Moses with the news.

The answer to the simplest questions and to the most complex problems is always the same. The answer is Jesus Christ. Every solution is found in Him.
Jesus Christ is the creator of innumerable inhabited worlds, if someone knows what he is doing, Jesus Christ does. He suffered for all of our sins and pains, he appeared to Joseph Smith, he is the answer to every question or problem we face in life.

so we've basically gotten it figured out that the Book of Mormon occured in Mesoamerica, then?

Just letting everyone know:
Wendy’s now charges $.70 for sauce after the first 2 free ones.

thoughts on sabbath day observance?
Exodus 20
20 And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God.
21 Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.
Exodus 23
12 Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.
Is it ok to work on the sabbath if you are experiencing very tough financial times?

25 So it was with me. I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages⁠, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true; and while they were persecuting me, reviling me, and speaking all manner of evil against me falsely for so saying, I was led to say in my heart: Why persecute me for telling the truth? I have actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand God, or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen? For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation.

If the veil were rent today, and the great God who holds this world in its orbit, and who upholds all worlds and all things by His power, was to make himself visible—I say, if you were to see him today, you would see him like a man in form—like yourselves in all the person, image, and very form as a man; for Adam was created in the very fashion, image and likeness of God, and received instruction from, and walked, talked and conversed with Him, as one man talks and communes with another.

In order to be a true follower of Christ you have to be willing to take some beatings. 
The Prophet Jeremiah was turtured and persecuted.
Joseph Smith was beat, thrown in jail, murdered. 
Abinadi was burned at the stake
Moroni was forced into hiding because all his community apostatized.

This teaches us that human strength is so small and arm so tiny, while God's arm is all powerful and can do anything, powerful verse.
Job 41
9 Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?

Alma 29
10 then do I remember what the Lord has done for me, yea, even that he hath heard my prayer; yea, then do I remember his merciful arm which he extended towards me.
The Lord is so merciful towards the children of men.

John 4:24 JST
For unto such hath God promised his Spirit. And they who worship him, must worship in spirit and in truth.
John 4
24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.
Generally, Protestants have a misunderstanding of John 4:24. Thanks to modern revelation from God through the Prophet Joseph Smith we have additional clarification that this verse is not teaching that God is a spirit, it is teaching that God hath promised his Spirit. Thus we can maintain the understanding that God has a body of flesh and bones, he is not a spirit.

“I confess that I cannot forbid a person to marry several wives, for it does not contradict the Scripture. If a man wishes to marry more than one wife he should be asked whether he is satisfied in his conscience that he may do so in accordance with the word of God. In such a case the civil authority has nothing to do in the matter."

🎤 Verse 1
Yo, the wise man steady with the plan in his hand,
Built his foundation on the solid rock stand,
Storms came crashin’, and the rain poured down,
But the house stood tall, couldn’t knock it to the ground.
🎤 Hook
Built on the rock, yeah, the rock don’t stop,
When the winds blow heavy and the raindrops drop,
House stay strong, the foundation won’t flop,
‘Cause the wise man’s faith put him right on top.
🎤 Verse 2
Foolish man thought that the sand was enough,
Looked real smooth but the base ain’t tough,
Waves rolled in and the winds got rough,
And the house came down—man, life got tough.
🎤 Bridge
So listen up, build your life on the stone,
On Christ the rock, you ain’t standin’ alone,
Storms gon’ come, but the truth’s well known—
With a firm foundation you can call that home.
🎤 Hook (repeat)
Built the rock, yeah, the rock don’t stop,
When the winds blow heavy and the raindrops drop,
House stay strong, the foundation won’t flop,
‘Cause the wise man’s faith put him right on top.

Jacob 1
13 Now the people which were not Lamanites were Nephites; nevertheless, they were called Nephites, Jacobites, Josephites, Zoramites, Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites.
2 Nephi 4
11 And after he had made an end of speaking unto them, he spake unto Sam, saying: Blessed art thou, and thy seed; for thou shalt inherit the land like unto thy brother Nephi. And thy seed shall be numbered with his seed; and thou shalt be even like unto thy brother, and thy seed like unto his seed; and thou shalt be blessed in all thy days.
One question is why are the "Samites" not mentioned in Jacob if Sam also receives the promise that his posterity will be numbered as the stars in the heavens?

Jaron 1
13 And it came to pass that two hundred and thirty and eight years had passed away—after the manner of wars, and contentions⁠, and dissensions, for the space of much of the time.

Here are some of the Ancient American civilizations that existed in or near Mesoamerica during the Book of Mormon times. 
Olmec (c. 1500–400 BC, Mesoamerica)
Often called the "mother culture" of Mesoamerica. Known for massive stone heads and early city-building. Their timeline overlaps with the Book of Mormon’s earliest periods.
Maya (c. 2000 BC–AD 1500, Mesoamerica)
Famous for pyramids, advanced calendars, writing, astronomy, and massive city-states like Tikal, Palenque, and Chichén Itzá. Their Classic period (AD 250–900) was long after the Book of Mormon ends, but early Maya groups existed during it.
Zapotec (c. 700 BC–AD 1521, Oaxaca, Mexico)
Builders of Monte Albán, one of the first major cities in the Americas, with writing and calendar systems developing alongside the Maya.
Teotihuacán (c. 100 BC–AD 550, Central Mexico)
Huge urban center with pyramids of the Sun and Moon. It rose toward the end of the Book of Mormon timeline.
Toltec (c. AD 900–1150, Central Mexico)
Later than the Book of Mormon, but influential in Mesoamerican culture and mythology.
Aztec (c. AD 1300–1521, Central Mexico)
Much later, but famous as the dominant empire when Europeans arrived.

Alma 34
41 But that ye have patience⁠, and bear with those afflictions⁠, with a firm hope that ye shall one day rest from all your afflictions.

Alma 9
11 Yea, and if it had not been for his matchless power, and his mercy, and his long-suffering towards us, we should unavoidably have been cut off from the face of the earth long before this period of time, and perhaps been consigned to a state of endless misery and woe.
Thanks to the mercy of God for sustain life from moment to moment. Without his mercy no life could even breathe, eat, or drink.

Mosiah 27
11 And as I said unto you, as they were going about rebelling against God, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto them; and he descended as it were in a cloud⁠; and he spake as it were with a voice of thunder, which caused the earth to shake upon which they stood;
Mosiah has many good stories one of which is when Alma and Mosiah establish the true church of Jesus Christ in the land and there begins to be much peace and properings. It is not long until the sons of Mosiah begin to heed the devil and lose belief in the church. They begin attacking and persecuting the church, and then an angel appears and asks them why they are doing this and they are stunned.

Job 7
12 Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?
13 When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;
14 Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:
15 So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.
16 I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.

Nehemiah 1
5 And said, I beseech thee, O Lord God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:

Job
Chapter 1
Job is a perfect upright man in Uz. He has lots of stuff.
Chapter 2
He loses even more stuff until he has basically nothing left
Chapter 3
He curses the day he was born and wishes he never could have been born. 
4 Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.

Leviticus 16
4 He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.
23 And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place⁠, and shall leave them there:
24 And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place⁠, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people.
32 And the priest⁠, whom he shall anoint⁠, and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the priest’s office in his father’s stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even the holy garments:

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, the restored gospel, the prophecies, revelations, convictions, remarks, claims, principles, authorities, teachings, doctrines, foretellings, truths, philosophies, messages, instructions, witnesses, guidances, insights, scriptures, are completely, guaranteed, fully, wholely, and honestly true and correct. The gospel of Jesus Christ contained in the Book of Mormon is thoroughly and comprehensively the same gospel taught by Jesus Christ himself and his humble followers in the Old Testament, New Testament, Pearl of Great Price, Doctrine and Covenants, Joseph Smith History,
Jesus Christ, the Jehovah of the Old Testament, the Messiah of the New Testament, appeared in the ancient americas after performing the infinite and eternal atonement and showed the prints in his hands and feet to the multitudes (3 Nephi 11:14-15). He came down to earth, was born in a lowly stable, walked and grew with man, taught principles of truth and righteousness, performed miracles, and eventually performed a ministry which involving the very son of god himself taking on the sins, pains, afflictions, sicknesses of all humanity, suffering an incomprehensible pain. Doing this, he descended below all things so that he could understand exactly what his spirit children go through in every circumstance (Alma 7:11). Under direction of the father, he created the whole earth with all the plants, trees, animals, lakes, oceans. He created Adam and Eve and placed them in the Garden of Eden. 
They were in a state of ending contentment until they partook of the fruit of the tree of good and evil and were cast down to earth where we all are currently living. (Genesis 2:17)
Not only has Jesus Christ created and authored the world upon which we are currently living, he has created other worlds, innumerable worlds, more worlds than a human can count. By the power of Jesus Christ, many worlds have come and gone, and many now stand.

John W. Welch:
One of the most amazing facts about the Book of Mormon is that it took Joseph Smith only about sixty-five working days to translate a book that, in the current edition, is 531 pages long. Historical details about the time it took to translate the book are remarkably well preserved, and they are corroborated by the independently consistent statements of numerous witnesses.
Neal A. Maxwell:
One marvel is the very rapidity with which Joseph was translating—at an estimated average rate of eight of our printed pages per day! The total translation time was about sixty-five working days.[3] By comparison, one able LDS translator in Japan, surrounded by reference books, language dictionaries, and translator colleagues ready to help if needed, indicated that he considered an output of one careful, final page a day to be productive. And he is retranslating from earlier Japanese to modern Japanese! More than fifty able English scholars labored for seven years, using previous translations, to produce the King James Version of the Bible, averaging about one precious page per day. The Prophet Joseph Smith would sometimes produce ten pages per day!
Neal A. Maxwell:
A second marvel of the Book of Mormon translation process is that from what we know, rarely would Joseph go back, review, or revise what had already been done. There was a steady flow in the translation. The Prophet's dictating resulted—just as the compositor, John H. Gilbert, remembered—in no paragraphing.
Emma Smith said of the inspired process: "After meals, or after interruptions, [Joseph] would at once begin where he had left off, without either seeing the manuscript or having any portion of it read to him."[6] One who has dictated and been interrupted must usually resume by inquiring, "Now, where were we?" Not so with the Prophet!
If one were manufacturing a text, he would constantly need to cross-check himself, to edit, and to revise for consistency. Had the Prophet dictated and revised extensively, there would be more evidence of it. But there was no need to revise divinely supplied text. Whatever the details of the translation process, we are discussing a process that was truly astonishing!
John W. Welch and Tim Rathbone:
Among the many amazing facts about the Book of Mormon is how little time it took for Joseph Smith to translate it. Recent research has shown more clearly than ever before that the Book of Mormon as we now have it was translated in a stunningly short amount of time. There was no time for outside research, rewriting, or polishing. Many contemporaneous historical documents sustain and validate the accuracy of Joseph Smith's account of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon.....
[A] span of no more than sixty-five to seventy-five total days was likely involved in translating the Book of Mormon as we now have it, for an overall average of about seven to eight pages per day, conservatively estimated. At such a pace, only about a week could have been taken to translate all of 1 Nephi; a day and half for King Benjamin's speech.
Moreover, Joseph and Oliver could not spend all of that time concentrating on the translation. They also took time to eat, to sleep, to seek employment (once, to work for money when supplies ran out), to receive the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods, to make at least one (and possibly two) trips to Colesville thirty miles away, to convert and baptize Hyrum and Samuel Smith (who came to Harmony at that time), to receive and record thirteen revelations that are now sections of the Doctrine and Covenants, to move on buckboard from Harmony to Fayette, to acquire the Book of Mormon copyright, to preach a few days and baptize several people near Fayette, to experience manifestations with the Three and Eight Witnesses, and to begin making arrangements for the Book of Mormon's publication.—
Oliver Cowdery:
These were days never to be forgotten-to sit under the sound of a voice dictated by the inspiration of heaven, awakened the utmost gratitude of this bosom! Day after day I continued, uninterrupted, to write from his mouth, as he translated, with the Urim and Thummim, or, as the Nephites would have said, 'Interpreters,' the history, or record, called 'The Book of Mormon.'
Joseph Smith III interviewed his mother Emma shortly before her death:
Question. Mother, what is your belief about the authenticity, or origin, of the Book of Mormon?
Answer. My belief is that the Book of Mormon is of divine authenticity - I have not the slightest doubt of it. I am satisfied that no man could have dictated the writing of the manuscripts unless he was inspired; for, when acting as his scribe, your father would dictate to me hour after hour; and when returning after meals, or after interruptions, he could at once begin where he had left off, without either seeing the manuscript or having any portion of it read to him. This was a usual thing for him to do. It would have been improbable that a learned man could do this; and, for one so ignorant and unlearned as he was, it was simply impossible.

If you remove quotes from the Bible, the Book of Mormon has about 258k words, compared to 184k words in the New Testament, and 77k in the Quran and the first Harry Potter novel. If Joseph just wanted a simple "sign" to fool his followers, why would he write so much and risk critics finding errors?
Due to many historical accounts, we know the Book of Mormon was translated over a span of 85 days, or about 65 days of full time work. That pace is about 2 months of full time translating. At the average ballpoint pen writing speed of 13 words per minute, it would take about 6 hours per day[2] to just write the words with a pen, and slower with quill and ink, with no time to invent new plot points. If he were lying in his journals and to his friends about his whereabouts to make his story look consistent for future generations, the math of his pace was right on. The LDS scholar Hugh Nibley challenged his students at Brigham Young University to write an entire book of scripture in a semester. Nobody succeeded.
Various computerized analysis of the Book of Mormon produces a U.S. reading grade level of 8-17.5, despite his limited education[3]. "Word Pattern" studies show the Book of Mormon had many authors, none of which match Joseph's writing style, or any of his associates.
There are 175 new characters/groups, 125 locations, dozens of stories and doctrines Joseph Smith had to keep straight. [4] Yet there is not one witness that he took any notes, or had an editor, or used a mound of reference books from the library.[5] Paper was very expensive in the 1820s, drafts would have been very costly and difficult to hide. All we have is the original text dictated without punctuation to a scribe onto paper which could not be erased or edited with software.
His wife Emma recalled: “He had neither manuscript nor book to read from. … If he had had anything of the kind he could not have concealed it from me.”[6]
But there is more. These arguments account only for the book’s historical content. The real issues still remain: how did Joseph produce a book that radiates with the Spirit, and where did he get such profound doctrine, much of which clarifies or contradicts the Christian beliefs of his time? For example, the Book of Mormon teaches, contrary to most Christian beliefs, that the Fall of Adam was a positive step forward. It reveals the covenants made at baptism, which are not addressed in the Bible. In addition, one might ask: where did Joseph get the powerful insight that because of Christ’s Atonement, He can not only cleanse us but also perfect us? Where did he get the stunning sermon on faith in Alma 32? Or King Benjamin’s sermon on the Savior’s Atonement, perhaps the most remarkable sermon on this subject in all scripture? Or the allegory of the olive tree with all its complexity and doctrinal richness? When I read this allegory, I have to map it out to follow its intricacies. Are we now supposed to believe that Joseph Smith just dictated these sermons off the top of his head with no notes whatsoever?
He would have had to con several people to keep his secret to the grave. He had 3 scribes who wrote as he translated, and he got 3 witnesses and 8 witnesses to say they saw the plates of gold. A few of these 11 left the church, but none ever denied.
There have been 100 million copies printed, and 16 million living members of the church who have been inspired by it. Millions will tell you they directly asked God if it was true, and their prayer was answered. There have been hundreds of articles and books written about the historical and cultural details Joseph Smith “accidentally” got right. For instance, the Book of Mormon accurately and in great detail describes earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, olive culture, guerrilla and traditional warfare, building ships, travel across oceans, Hebrew and Egyptian naming and grammatical styles, chiasmus, and geography of the Middle East and the Americas.
Is there any other book of this length, written this quickly, written by a writing rookie, with such spiritual depth, with so many consistent characters, stories, locations and doctrines, with so many copies printed, and written by only 1 writer? Either Joseph Smith was a literary genius, or he was telling the truth.

Doctrine and Covenants 121
10 Thou art not yet as Job; thy friends do not contend against thee, neither charge thee with transgression, as they did Job.
Job 4
1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
2 If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?
3 Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.
4 Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.
5 But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
6 Is not this thy fear, thy confidence⁠, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?
7 Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent⁠? or where were the righteous cut off?
8 Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.
Job 13
4 But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.
Job 16
2 I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.

Job 31
6 Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity⁠.
Job asks that he receives a just judgement from God so that if he is wicked, which he firmly believes he is not, then he will receive the proper punishment. 
The entire chapter of 31 is Job freely welcoming punishment for any sin or wrong he has committed. He is trying to justify his righteousness and show to all that he is not wicked. And in 32 Elihu responds angrily. Elihu did not like how Job is calling himself righteous. He wants Job to call God righteous and especially in the sense of what God has allowed to happen to Job. Elihu wants to say that God has punished Job for wickedness
This is why he is unhappy with Job’s claims of justifying his own behavior in being righteous.

CHAPTER 13
Job testifies of his confidence in the Lord and says, Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him, and He also will be my salvation.
1 Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it.
2 What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.
3 Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.
4 But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.
5 O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.
6 Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
7 Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?
8 Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?
9 Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him?
10 He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.
11 Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?
12 Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.
13 Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will.
14 Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?
15 Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.
16 He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.
17 Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.
18 Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified⁠.
19 Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.
20 Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.
21 Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.
22 Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.
23 How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.
24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?
25 Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?
26 For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.
27 Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.
28 And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.

Another property I went to mow the lawn and what do you know?? The grass was so patchy and dying…
I sent this picture to my dad he says sure enough the grass is dying how could this be? Apparently the grass was not getting enough water… 
I looked around and there was indeed a sprinkler system installed, so why was the grass not being properly watered? 
I took a closer look inside the garage and the irrigation control was set to run station 1 each day at 6 am. 
Then I took a closer look at the grass and noticed there were patches of green near each sprinkler head. So I turned on station 1 manually and boom the sprinklers were turning on, but the heads were not coming up all the way so I looked in the sprinkler box and discovered…. One of the valves was partially closed… the valve for station 1. So all I did was slightly rotate it counter clockwise and boom the pressure went back up to normal and the sprinkler heads shot up and started covering the entire lawn. What a victory. ✌️

Doctrine and Covenants 132
55 But if she will not abide this commandment, then shall my servant Joseph do all things for her, even as he hath said; and I will bless him and multiply him and give unto him an hundred-fold in this world, of fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, houses and lands, wives and children, and crowns of eternal lives in the eternal worlds.

“‘I have pulled my handcart when I was so weak and weary from illness and lack of food that I could hardly put one foot ahead of the other. I have looked ahead and seen a patch of sand or a hill slope and I have said, I can go only that far and there I must give up, for I cannot pull the load through it.’” He continues: “‘I have gone on to that sand and when I reached it, the cart began pushing me. I have looked back many times to see who was pushing my cart, but my eyes saw no one. I knew then that the angels of God were there.
“‘Was I sorry that I chose to come by handcart? No. Neither then nor any minute of my life since. The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay, and I am thankful that I was privileged to come in the Martin Handcart Company.⁠’” (⁠Relief Society Magazine, Jan. 1948, p. 8.)
Here then is a great truth. In the pain, the agony, and the heroic endeavors of life, we pass through a refiner’s fire, and the insignificant and the unimportant in our lives can melt away like dross and make our faith bright, intact, and strong. In this way the divine image can be mirrored from the soul. It is part of the purging toll exacted of some to become acquainted with God.

Several verses in the Book of Mormon contain geographical descriptions. 
1 Nephi 18
22 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did guide the ship, that we sailed again towards the promised land.
23 And it came to pass that after we had sailed for the space of many days we did arrive at the promised land; and we went forth upon the land, and did pitch our tents; and we did call it the promised land.
You sent
I am looking for some clues as to whether Lehi's family sailed accross the Atlantic ocean or the Pacific ocean. I am looking at 1 Nephi 18:22-23, and I am having a difficult time extracting clues on the matter.
It may also be worth considering the number of days or months that it would typically take to travel from the Arabian peninsula through either the Pacific Ocean, or south of Africa through the Atlantic Ocean. The text says the "had sailed for the space of many days" 
I am curious how many days Nephi would consider "many days"

Ezekiel 17
8 It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.
has a correlation to
Jacob 5
25 And he said unto the servant: Look hither and behold the last. Behold, this have I planted in a good spot of ground; and I have nourished it this long time, and only a part of the tree hath brought forth tame fruit, and the other part of the tree hath brought forth wild fruit; behold, I have nourished this tree like unto the others.
because both mention a "good spot" of soil where the a seed was planted so that it could produce good fruit.

Jacob 5
11 And the Lord of the vineyard caused that it should be digged about, and pruned, and nourished, saying unto his servant: It grieveth me that I should lose this tree; wherefore, that perhaps I might preserve the roots thereof that they perish not, that I might preserve them unto myself, I have done this thing.
Jacob 5 teaches an allegory of what the Lord is willing to do to save his people. He works with his servants to soften the ground of the branches and tree roots so that they can take up deeper root and grow more. It says, "it grieveth me that I should lose this tree"
This is how Jesus Christ feels about every single one of his spirit children. It "grieveth" Jesus Christ the thought of him losing any of his children and so he  does whatever he can to save them. Unfortunately, despite even Jesus Christ's best efforts, sometimes his spirit children use their agency to choose not to repent. We see this in the example of Cain and Able. Cain decided to follow Satan, while Able decided to serve the Lord. And so Satan told Cain to kill Able, which he did and it was a serious sin. It is alwaus so important to not follow Satan and instead to follow Jesus Christ.

1 Nephi 15
25 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did exhort them to give heed unto the word of the Lord; yea, I did exhort them with all the energies of my soul, and with all the faculty which I possessed, that they would give heed to the word of God and remember to keep his commandments always in all things.
I feel like Nephi, very desirous for the welfare of your souls. My anxiety is great for the souls of all of you, that you will hearken to the words of the Lord. I exhort you with all the energies of my soul that you will heed the word of God and keep his commandments in all things.

The curse remained upon them because Cain cut off the lives [sic] of Abel, to prevent him and his posterity getting ascendency over Cain and his generations, and to get the lead himself, his own offering was not being accepted of God, while Abel’s was. But the Lord cursed Cain’s seed with blackness and prohibited them the priesthood, that Abel and his progeny might yet come forward, and have their dominion, place, and blessings in their proper relationship with Cain and his race in the world to come

Doctrine and covenants 127
2 And as for the perils which I am called to pass through, they seem but a small thing to me, as the envy and wrath of man have been my common lot all the days of my life; and for what cause it seems mysterious, unless I was ordained from before the foundation of the world for some good end, or bad, as you may choose to call it. Judge ye for yourselves. God knoweth all these things, whether it be good or bad. But nevertheless, deep water is what I am wont to swim in. It all has become a second nature to me; and I feel, like Paul, to glory in tribulation; for to this day has the God of my fathers delivered me out of them all, and will deliver me from henceforth; for behold, and lo, I shall triumph over all my enemies, for the Lord God hath spoken it.

Several references to tithing are found in the scriptures. The same reference is included in Malachi 3
8 ¶ Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.
9 Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.
10 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.
and in 3 Nephi 24
8 Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say: Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.
9 Ye are cursed with a curse, for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.
10 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in my house; and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of Hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it.
Both references include a promise from the Lord that if we pay tithing, he will "open the windows of heaven, and pour out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive." This is quite a powerful promise. That means if we pay tithing we will be blessed with a blessing so big, we won't even be able to receive it. We see an occasion where Abraham is blessed with such a blessing that the Lord promises:
Genesis 7
11 ¶ In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.
Robert D. Hales said, "tithing is a test of faith with eternal blessings." 
and also said, "Tithing develops and tests our faith. By sacrificing to the Lord what we may think we need or want for ourselves, we learn to rely on Him."
Elder Hales also told us that some of the blessings of tithing are temporal, others are spiritual. 
We also see another reference when Jacob covenants to pay tithing.
Genesis 28
22 And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God’s house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.
I know that the Lord blesses us with a blessings so big we don't even have room enough to receive it when we pay tithing and I am so thankful for the opportunity to do that. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

1 Kings 22
48 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.
This is important because Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they never made it because they were broken at Ezion-geber. 
2 Nephi 12:16 And upon all the ships of the sea, and upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.
There may be a slight connection between the 2 verses. 1 Kings 22 uses "Tharshish" and 2 Nephi uses "Tarshish"

2 Nephi 29
3 And because my words shall hiss forth—many of the Gentiles shall say: A Bible! A Bible! We have got a Bible, and there cannot be any more Bible.
Here is a prophecy from the Book of Mormon that the Lord's words will "hiss forth" in our day and many people will say we have a Bible, so we have enough. We already have the Bible, why do we need anything more? This prophecy is clearly coming to pass before our eyes when many voices shout that we already have the Bible, so why do we need the Book of Mormon? 
The combination of the Book of Mormon and the JST of the Bible and other revelations by Joseph Smith result in a large sum of truths and doctrines that have either been added to the Bible or corrected errors in the Bible that occured as the Bible was mis translated over the course of hundreds of years. Many important truths related to salvation were lost and then restored in clarity and boldness through Joseph Smith. 
Prophet Joseph Smith said in 1832, “From sundry revelations which have been received, it was apparent that many important points touching the salvation of man, had been taken from the Bible, or lost before it was compiled. I believe the Bible as it read when it came from the pen of the original writers. Ignorant translators, careless transcribers, or designing and corrupt priests have committed many errors”
Bart Ehrman, an Associate Professor of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina wrote, that there are 5,366 copies of the original New Testament texts that have survived over time. With the exception of the smallest fragments, no two of these copies are exactly alike. The number of differences must be in the hundreds of thousands. Scribes sometimes even changed them to align better with their own theology.

2 Thessalonians 2
3 Let no man deceive you by any means; for there shall come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;
2 Thessalonians teaches us that Jesus Christ’s original church was prophecies to fall away before the 2nd coming. This is why it is so important for the church to be restored again starting in 1820. 
It would not have been possible for a 22 year old farm boy with limited education to produce a complex 530 literary masterpiece with Hebraic structures, consistent geography, varying author styles.

Brigham Young
“How many Gods there are, I do not know. But there never was a time when there were not Gods and worlds, and when men were not passing through the same ordeals [mortality] that we are now passing through. That course has been from all eternity, and it is and will be to all eternity.”

Alma 43:51,"Now, the Lamanites were more numerous, yea, by more than double the number of the Nephites; nevertheless, they were driven insomuch that they were gathered together in one body in the valley, upon the bank by the river Sidon."
Alma 43:53,"Therefore when Zerahemnah saw the men of Lehi on the east of the river Sidon, and the armies of Moroni on the west of the river Sidon, that they were encircled about by the Nephites, they were struck with terror."
Alma 43:41,"And it came to pass that Moroni and his army met the Lamanites in the valley, on the other side of the river Sidon, and began to fall upon them and to slay them."
Alma 43:40,"And they were pursued by Lehi and his men; and they were driven by Lehi into the waters of Sidon, and they crossed the waters of Sidon. And Lehi retained his armies upon the bank of the river Sidon that they should not cross."
Alma 43:39,"And it came to pass that the Lamanites became frightened, because of the great destruction among them, even until they began to flee towards the river Sidon."
Alma 43:35,"And as the Lamanites had passed the hill Riplah, and came into the valley, and began to cross the river Sidon, the army which was concealed on the south of the hill, which was led by a man whose name was Lehi, and he led his army forth and encircled the Lamanites about on the east in their rear."
Alma 43:32,"And the remainder he concealed in the west valley, on the west of the river Sidon, and so down into the borders of the land Manti."
Alma 43:27,"And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his army should be secreted in the valley which was near the bank of the river Sidon, which was on the west of the river Sidon in the wilderness."
Alma 43:22,"Behold, now it came to pass that they durst not come against the Nephites in the borders of Jershon; therefore they departed out of the land of Antionum into the wilderness, and took their journey round about in the wilderness, away by the head of the river Sidon, that they might come into the land of Manti and take possession of the land; for they did not suppose that the armies of Moroni would know whither they had gone."
Alma 49:16,"And behold, Moroni had appointed Lehi to be chief captain over the men of that city; and it was that same Lehi who fought with the Lamanites in the valley on the east of the river Sidon."
Alma 50:11,"And thus he cut off all the strongholds of the Lamanites in the east wilderness, yea, and also on the west, fortifying the line between the Nephites and the Lamanites, between the land of Zarahemla and the land of Nephi, from the west sea, running by the head of the river Sidon--the Nephites possessing all the land northward, yea, even all the land which was northward of the land Bountiful, according to their pleasure."
Alma 16:7,"And it came to pass that Zoram and his sons crossed over the river Sidon, with their armies, and marched away beyond the borders of Manti into the south wilderness, which was on the east side of the river Sidon."
Alma 16:6,"And it came to pass that Alma inquired of the Lord concerning the matter. And Alma returned and said unto them: Behold, the Lamanites will cross the river Sidon in the south wilderness, away up beyond the borders of the land of Manti. And behold there shall ye meet them, on the east of the river Sidon, and there the Lord will deliver unto thee thy brethren who have been taken captive by the Lamanites."
Alma 3:3,"And now as many of the Lamanites and the Amlicites who had been slain upon the bank of the river Sidon were cast into the waters of Sidon; and behold their bones are in the depths of the sea, and they are many."
Alma 2:35,"And it came to pass that when they had all crossed the river Sidon that the Lamanites and the Amlicites began to flee before them, notwithstanding they were so numerous that they could not be numbered."
Alma 2:34,"And thus he cleared the ground, or rather the bank, which was on the west of the river Sidon, throwing the bodies of the Lamanites who had been slain into the waters of Sidon, that thereby his people might have room to cross and contend with the Lamanites and the Amlicites on the west side of the river Sidon."
Alma 2:27,"And behold, as they were crossing the river Sidon, the Lamanites and the Amlicites, being as numerous almost, as it were, as the sands of the sea, came upon them to destroy them."
Alma 2:15,"And it came to pass that the Amlicites came upon the hill Amnihu, which was east of the river Sidon, which ran by the land of Zarahemla, and there they began to make war with the Nephites."
Alma 6:7,"And now it came to pass that when Alma had made these regulations he departed from them, yea, from the church which was in the city of Zarahemla, and went over upon the east of the river Sidon, into the valley of Gideon, there having been a city built, which was called the city of Gideon, which was in the valley that was called Gideon, being called after the man who was slain by the hand of Nehor with the sword."
Alma 8:3,"And it came to pass in the commencement of the tenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, that Alma departed from thence and took his journey over into the land of Melek, on the west of the river Sidon, on the west by the borders of the wilderness."
Alma 22:29,"And also there were many Lamanites on the east by the seashore, whither the Nephites had driven them. And thus the Nephites were nearly surrounded by the Lamanites; nevertheless the Nephites had taken possession of all the northern parts of the land bordering on the wilderness, at the head of the river Sidon, from the east to the west, round about on the wilderness side; on the north, even until they came to the land which they called Bountiful."
Alma 22:27,"And it came to pass that the king sent a proclamation throughout all the land, amongst all his people who were in all his land, who were in all the regions round about, which was bordering even to the sea, on the east and on the west, and which was divided from the land of Zarahemla by a narrow strip of wilderness, which ran from the sea east even to the sea west, and round about on the borders of the seashore, and the borders of the wilderness which was on the north by the land of Zarahemla, through the borders of Manti, by the head of the river Sidon, running from the east towards the west--and thus were the Lamanites and the Nephites divided."
here is every verse in the Book of Mormon that mentions the phrase 'river sidon'

When Joseph Smith was 17 years old, he was praying for forgiveness and the angel Moroni from ancient times appeared to him miraculously. He taught Joseph things about what he was supposed to do. 
I often ponder this event. Moroni has always been an important role model for me because he is very righteous. He is constantly finding ways to prepare for the attacks from his enemies and fortify his people and develop their strongholds. 
He is a glorified being whose countenance is bright and powerful. I'm sure even just being in his presence was powerful for Joseph Smith. I hope I can continue to be more like Moroni and also more like Jesus Christ.
Alma 48
17 Yea, verily, verily I say unto you, if all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of men.

from the mid-1800s until 1978—the Church did not ordain men of black African descent to its priesthood or allow black men or women to participate in temple endowment or sealing ordinances.
During the first two decades of the Church’s existence, a few black men were ordained to the priesthood. One of these men, Elijah Able, also participated in temple ceremonies in Kirtland, Ohio, and was later baptized as proxy for deceased relatives in Nauvoo, Illinois. There is no reliable evidence that any black men were denied the priesthood during Joseph Smith’s lifetime.
In 1852 President Brigham Young publicly announced that men of black African descent could no longer be ordained to the priesthood, though thereafter black people continued to join the Church through baptism and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost. Following the death of Brigham Young, subsequent Church Presidents restricted black members from receiving the temple endowment or being married in the temple. Over time, Church leaders and members advanced many theories to explain the priesthood and temple restrictions. None of these explanations is accepted today as the official doctrine of the Church.

Doctrine and Covenants 35
13 Wherefore, I call upon the weak things of the world, those who are unlearned and despised, to thresh the nations by the power of my Spirit;
if we obey christ and his doctrine we will "thresh the nations by the power of his Spirit" powerful!

Joseph Smith was an astonishingly committed prophet and disciple. One of the best examples of this I have found was during his leadership of Zion's Camp. 
"Members of Zion’s Camp endured a limited food and water supply, unsanitary conditions, traveling through humidity, rain, and mud for sometimes as many as 40 miles a day. The difficulties lead to some members of Zion’s Camp becoming greatly discouraged and Joseph exhorted them “to humble themselves before the Lord and become united, that they might not be scourged.”"
Can you imagine walking 40 miles/day and being told to be humbled before the Lord? 
I am certain those saints reached new levels of humility they had never felt before. It can be hard to swallow pride, yet I have found in my life that without sufficient humility, I am blinded to the marvelous workings of Jesus Christ and do not have his influence in my life. When I do humble myself, I am then willing to pray and read the Book of Mormon and seek the Lord. 
Helaman 6 says
5 Yea, and many did preach with exceedingly great power and authority, unto the bringing down many of them into the depths of humility, to be the humble followers of God and the Lamb.
If we are willing to bring ourselves down to the depths of humility, I am certain that we truly can meet the Lord, and if we continue in humility, we can continue to get to know him. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

The Book of Mormon tells us one of King Zedekiah's sons was named Mulek and he escaped and came to the new world 
Helaman 6
> 10 Now the land south was called Lehi, and the land north was called Mulek, which was after the son of Zedekiah; for the Lord did bring Mulek into the land north, and Lehi into the land south.
Helaman 8
> 21 And now will you dispute that Jerusalem was destroyed? Will ye say that the sons of Zedekiah were not slain, all except it were Mulek? Yea, and do ye not behold that the seed of Zedekiah are with us, and they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem? But behold, this is not all—
The Bible says Zedekiah and his sons were killed by King Nebuchadnezzar II, during the Babylonian captivity
2 Kings 
> 1 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it; and they built forts against it round about.
> 2 And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
> 3 And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.
> 4 ¶ And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king’s garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain.
> 5 And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him.
> 6 So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.
> 7 And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon.
A stamp seal of a royal figure was found in the 1980s by archeologists digging in Jerusalem dated to the time of Zedekiah (who reigned from 618 - 587 BC) written in Paleo-Hebrew. It calls the royal figure Malkiyahu, son of the king (which would have been Zedekiah as of that date). One of the shortened Hebrew variants of this name would be Mulek.

John and Elsa Johnson had come from Hiram, Ohio, with Ezra Booth to meet Joseph Smith who they had heard so much about.
Elsa Johnson had a broken arm and Joseph Smith asked her if she believed God could heal it. She answered, "yes". Joseph Smith then said, "Woman, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I command thee to be whole.'” 
Everyone was awe-stricken and asked if Elsa was healed and she immediately stretched out her straight arm and it was healed. 
Moroni 7 
37 Behold I say unto you, Nay; for it is by faith that miracles are wrought;

Hosea 13
4 Yet I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no god but me: for there is no saviour beside me.
We learn some powerful lessons about returning to the Lord after sinning from the prophet Hosea. Hosea powerfully taught the principle of repentance to the Northern Kingdom. Even after they committed such whoredoms and abominations, the Lord was still willing to let them eventually repent.

“I’ve got 112 pages of just quotations and we’ve double checked to make sure we have them word-for-word and we’re working on getting this published. After going through 112 pages of people who saw the papyri or the mummies, most of them say nothing about the source of the Book of Abraham. Only a few do. And those who do are usually not very clear about exactly what the source is. There are a few, a very few, that are and they agree that the source is the long roll, the long roll of papyrus.”
This is what Kerry Muhlestein said about the papyri Joseph Smith used to translate the Book of Abraham a couple years ago. Does anyone have access to these quotes?
He said a few witnesses suggest he used the long scroll to translate the book of Abraham

The basic concept of the VIX is that it is a mathematical calculation of the price of options of the SP500
The 2 main indicators that determine prices of options are #1 time to expiration and #2 volatility of the underlying asset, though other indicators also have an effect. 
So if any uncertainty enters the market which could happen for a variety of reasons, volatility of the sp500 increases which would increase the prices of options which drives the value of the VIX (CBOE) and other volatility trackers up.

In June of 1878, Wilford Woodruff recorded a vision that he had in December of 1877. He saw many harsh things of blood and carnage. He saw many dead bodies. He saw death and war and murder and bloodshed. After seeing much of this, he saw "myriads of Angels hovering over them and around about them and also an immens pillar of a cloud over them and I heard the singing of the most beautif music the words "Now is esstablished the Kingdom of our God and his Christ and He shall reign forever and Ever, and the Kingdom shall never be Thrown down for the Saints have overcome""
He heard a voice say "Now shall come to pass that which was spoken by Isaiah the Prophet "That seven women shall take hold of one man saying["] &c. [Isaiah 4:1]"
Wilford Woodruff was surely a prophet and had many powerful manifestations from the Lord.

15 A hand pointing to the right I wrote 28 & spent most of the day in the office
I had a vary strange vision copied in the office to day
of a Desolating sickness which covered the whole land
A Vision
Salt Lake City, Night of Dec 16, 1877
I [blank] went to bed at my usual hour half past nine oclok I had been reading the Revolations in the French Language, my mind was calm, more so than usual if possible to be so. I composed myself for sleep but could not sleep. I felt a strange stupor come over me and apparently became partially unconscious, still I was not asleep, nor awoke With a strange far away dreamy feelings the first I recognized was that I was in the Tabernacle at Ogden sitting on the back seat in the corner for fear they would call upon me to Preach which after singing the second time, they did by calling me to the stand. I arose to speak and said I did not know that I had any thing special to say except to bear my Testimony to the Truth of the Latter Day work when all at once it seemed as though I was lifted out of myself, and I said "yes I have sumthing to say, it is this—some of my brethren present have been asking me what is coming to pass, what is the wind blowing up. I will answer you right here what is coming to pass shortly. I was immediately in Salt Lake City wandering about the streets in all parts of the city and on the door of every house I found a badge of mourning, and I could not find a house but what was in mourning. I passed by my own house and saw the same sigm there, and asked "Is that me that is dead?" Sumthing gave me answer "No youll live through it all." It seemed strange to me that I saw no person [on] the street in my wandering about through the city, they seemed to be in their houses with their sick and Dead. I saw no funeral possession, or any thing of that kind, but the city looked vary still and quiet as though the people were praying and had controll of the desease what ever it was I then looked in all directions over the Territory, East West North and South, and I found the same mourn- ing in every place throughout the Land. The next I knew I was Just this side of Omaha. It seemed as though I was above the Earth, looking down to it as I passed along on my way East and I saw the roads full of people principally women with just what they could carry in bundles on therir backs travelling to the mountains on foot, and I wond- ered how they could get there, with nothing but a small pack upon their backs. It was remarkable to me that there were so few men among them, it did not seem as though the cars were running the rails looked rusty, and the road abandoned, And I have no conception how I travelled myself As I looked down upon the people I continued Eastward through Omaha and Council Bluffs which were full of disease, and women every whare. The states of Missouri and Illinois were in turmoil and strife Men killing each other, and women joining in the fight, family against family cutting each other to peaieces in the most horrid manner. The next I saw was Washington, and I found the city a Desolation. The white House Empty, the Halls of Congress the same. Every thing in ruins, the people seemed to have fled from the city and left it to take care of itself. I was next in the city of Baltimore and in the square whare the Monument of 1812 stands, in front of St Charles and other Hotels I saw the Dead piled up so high as to fill the square I saw Mothers cut the throats of thereir own children for the sake of their blood, which they drank from their veins, to quench their thirst and then lie down and die. The waters of the Chesapeake and of the city were so stagnant and such a stench arose from them on account of the putrefaction of Dead bodies that the vary smell caused Death, and that was singular again I saw no men except they were dead, lying in the streets, and vary few women, and they were crazy mad, and in a dying condition Every whare I went I beheld the same all over the city, And it was horrible beyound description As I looked down upon the people I continued Eastward through Omaha and Council Bluffs which were full of disease, and women every whare. The states of Missouri and Illinois were in turmoil and strife Men killing each other, and women joining in the fight, family against family cutting each other to peaieces in the most horrid manner. The next I saw was Washington, and I found the city a Desolation. The white House Empty, the Halls of Congress the same. Every thing in ruins, the people seemed to have fled from the city and left it to take care of itself. I was next in the city of Baltimore and in the square whare the Monument of 1812 stands, in front of St Charles and other Hotels I saw the Dead piled up so high as to fill the square I saw Mothers cut the throats of thereir own children for the sake of their blood, which they drank from their veins, to quench their thirst and then lie down and die. The waters of the Chesapeake and of the city were so stagnant and such a stench arose from them on account of the putrefaction of Dead bodies that the vary smell caused Death, and that was singular again I saw no men except they were dead, lying in the streets, and vary few women, and they were crazy mad, and in a dying condition Every whare I went I beheld the same all over the city, And it was horrible beyound description to look at. I thought this must be the End. But No I was seemingly in Philadelphia and there every- thing was still no living soul was to be seen to greet me, and it seemed as though the whole city was without an inhabitant. In arch and chestnut street and in fact Every whare I went the putrifaction of the Dead bodies caused such a stench that it was Impossible for any creature to Exhist alive, nor did I see any living thing in the city. I next found myself in Broadway New York and here it seemed the people had done their best to overcome the Disease. But in wandering down Broadway I saw the bodies of Beautiful women lying stone dead, and others in a dying condition on the side walk. I saw men crawl out of the cellars and rob the dead bodies of the valuables they had on and before they could return to their coverts in the cellars they themselves would roll over a time or towo and die in agony. On some of the back streets I saw Mothers kill their own children and Eat raw flesh and then in a few minuts die themselves. Whareever I went I saw the same scenes of Horror and Desolation rapine and Death. No Horses or carriages, No busses or street cars, but Death and Destruction evry whare I then went to the Grand Central Park and looking back I saw a fire start and just at that moment a mighty East wind sprang up and carried the flames west over the city, and it burned untill there was not a single building left standing whole Even down to the wharfs, and the shiping all seemed to be burned and swallowed up in the common destruction and left Nothing but a Desolation whare the great city was a short time before. The stench from the bodies that were burning was so great that it was carried a great distance across the Hudson River and bay, and thus spread deisease and death whareever the flames penetrated. I cannot paint in words the Horror that seemed to Encompass me around It was beyound description or thought of man to conceive. I supposed this was the End but I was here given to understand, that the same horror was being enacted all over the country, North South East and West, that few were left alive still there were some. Immediately after I seemed to be standing on the west bank of the Missouri River opposite the city of Independance but I saw no city. I saw the whole states of Missouri & Illinois and part of Iowa were a com- plete wilderness with no living human being im them. I then saw a short distance from the river Twelve men dressed in the robes of the Temple stand[in]g in a square or nearly so. I understood it respresented the Twelve gates of the New Jerrusalem, and they were with hands uplifted consecrating the ground and laying the Corner Stones. I saw myriads of Angels hovering over them and around about them and also an immens pillar of a cloud over them and I heard the singing of the most beautif music the words "Now is esstablished the Kingdom of our God and his Christ and He shall reign forever and Ever, and the Kingdom shall never be Thrown down for the Saints have overcome" and I saw people coming from the River and different places a long way off to help build the Temple, and it seemed that the Hosts of the angels also helped to get the material to build the Temple, and I saw some come who wore their Temple clothing rob[e]s to help build the Temple and the city and all the time I saw the great pillar of cloud hovering over the place Instantly I found I was in the Tabernacle at Ogden yet I could see the building going on and got quite animated in calling to the people in the Tabernacle to listen to the beautiful music that the Angels were Making. I called to them to look at the Angels as the House seemed to be full of them and they were saying the same words that I heard Before "Now is the Kingdom of Our God Esstablished forever & Ever.["] and then a voice said "Now shall come to pass that which was spoken by Isaiah the Prophet "That seven women shall take hold of one man saying["] &c. [Isaiah 4:1] At this time I seemed to stagger back from the pulpit & F D Richards and some one els caught me and prevented me from falling when I requested Brother Richards to apologise to the audience for me because I stoped so adruptly and tell them I had not fainted but was exhausted. I rolled over in my bed and heard the City Hall clock strike Twelve

I have created a post to offer advice to any of those who are struggling to reconcile seemingly contradictory ideas with faith or religion or spiritual claims of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or other churches or religious organizations. Whether it may be church history topics or stories, polygamy, church finances, church policies, Joseph Smith quotes, stories, teachings, personal stories, challenges, struggles, or events, scriptural discrepancies, or any other version of things that seem to contradict spiritual or religious claims no matter how broad or specific. 
As you will find in the post, towards the end I give the simple answer to these questions, concerns, doubts, or struggles. The answer is to repent and have faith in Jesus Christ. If you repent and have faith in Jesus Christ, your spiritual eyes will be opened and you will see that Jesus Christ is a real being who does in fact exist. No church history fact or personal struggle can deteriorate this divine, universal truth in any sliver of a way. In the post I share a quote from President Nelson that, no matter what questions or problems we may have, the answer is always Jesus Christ. 
So please share your thoughts with me about the post and the insights found therein. I am curious to hear your thoughts and critiques of the post. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

John E. Page, who was one of the 12 apostles called by Joseph Smith said, “All who are familiar with the Book of Mormon are probably aware of the fact that the whole account of the history of the fore fathers of the American Indians, called the Nephites, Lamanites and Zoramites, is confined to Central America entirely until the 394th page.”
I see many scholars agreeing with the Mesoamerican model, but I'm not certain about it yet. I would like to continue to study the relevant references that support this model. I also see some scholars to be quite certain about the Heartland model, and other various models or variations or combinations of any such models such as the Limited Geography Model.

If anyone is wrestling with church history or other church topics such as:
- Joseph Smith and polygamy, Brigham Young and polygamy, Wilford Woodruff and polygamy
- The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints methods of handling the tithing funds and investments
- church finances, Ensign Peak Advisors reports to the SEC
- Joseph Smith translations of the Book of Mormon
- the kinderhook plates
- contradictions between the Bible and the Book of Mormon
- discrepancies between the Egyptian papyri and the book of Abraham
- Book of Mormon historicity
- Book of Mormon geographical evidence or lack thereof
- Book of Mormon anachronisms
- racial priesthood restrictions and the fact that blacks could not receive the priesthood until 1987
- reconciling evolution with Adam and Eve
- reconciling scientific accounts of the creation of earth and the emergence of life itself and the creation account recorded in Genesis or Abraham
- reconciling Luke 23:43 (And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.) with spirit paradise and protestant views
- reconciling Revelations 22:18–19 “And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.” with the Book of Mormon being another text to the Bible.
- the change in the introduction in of the Book of Mormon in 2006 from
“After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites, and they are the principal ancestors of the American Indians.”
 To
“After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites, and they are among the ancestors of the American Indians.”
I would love to talk with you about any of these topics because I love studying them and diving deeper into them. 
But I would also invite you to take your questions to the Lord and ask him in sincere prayer because I know he “give the wisdom to all men liberally” as we read from James (James 1:5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.)
I have a testimony that Joseph Smith saw God the Father and Jesus Christ in the sacred grove, and translated the Book of Mormon by the power of God after multiple meetings with the angel Moroni. I also have a testimony that Adam and Eve were placed in the garden and partook of the fruit of the tree of good and evil.

Doctrine and Covenants 132:54 And I command mine handmaid, Emma Smith, to abide and cleave unto my servant Joseph, and to none else. But if she will not abide this commandment she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord; for I am the Lord thy God, and will destroy her if she abide not in my law.
God commanded Emma Smith to remain with Joseph Smith during his practices of polygamy or else she will be destroyed. This makes sense to me because they had both already been sealed so it was part of the new and everlasting covenant that they remain faithful to 1 another. Although I’m sure it must have felt uncomfortable for both Emma and Joseph to be together while Joseph was marrying and associating with other women through the new and everlasting covenant.

Jacob 2
> 24 Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord.
Doctrine and Covenants 132
> 38 David also received many wives and concubines, and also Solomon and Moses my servants, as also many others of my servants, from the beginning of creation until this time; and in nothing did they sin save in those things which they received not of me.
My current understanding is that David did not sin in most or all of his wives and concubines until he slept with Bethsheba. And Solomon also sinned by marrying some of his wives and others he did not sin. This the phrase “save in this things which they received not of me”
we read in 1 Kings that Solomon had 700 wives, 300 concubines.
1 Kings 11
3 And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.
4 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of David his father.

I have written another post about the creation. So I reference some verses from Genesis, describing the process of the creation. Each day God created something different until day 7 when he rested. Obviously, there is a lot more content related to the creation than what I have covered here. I plan to continue learning and adding to it slowly here and there. 

The Prophet Joseph Smith said, “I told the brethren that The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book"
I know we can get closer to Jesus Christ by abiding by the precepts of the The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ than any other book because the Book of Mormon contains the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It was translated by Joseph Smith by the power of God using the Urim and Thummim and the Seer stone.

"Not half — not one-hundredth part — not a thousandth part of that which Joseph Smith revealed to the Church has yet been unfolded, either to the Church or to the world."
- Elder B.H. Roberts 
He tells us that only a small fraction, less than 1/1000 of the things that God knows have been revealed to the church or to humanity.
