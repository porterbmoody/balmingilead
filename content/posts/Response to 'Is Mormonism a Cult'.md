This is a response to the article (Mormonism is a Cult)[https://carm.org/mormonism/is-mormonism-a-cult/]

the Bible says thereâ€™s only one God in all existence (Isaiah 43:10; 44:6; 45:5), but Mormonism says there are many gods, (Mormon Doctrine, p. 163)

Isaiah 43:10

> Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me
