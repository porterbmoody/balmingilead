## More that 1 God
This is a response to the article [Mormonism is a Cult](https://carm.org/mormonism/is-mormonism-a-cult/)

"The Bible says there’s only one God in all existence (Isaiah 43:10; 44:6; 45:5), but Mormonism says there are many gods, (Mormon Doctrine, p. 163)"

So they say the Bible says there is only 1 God, but sources of LDS doctrine say there are multiple Gods. 

Isaiah 43:10

> Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me

Isaiah 44:6

> 6 Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, and his redeemer the Lord of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.

Isaiah 45:5

> 5 ¶ I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:

Abreham 4:3

> 3 And they (the Gods) said: Let there be light; and there was light.

I can't find the quote in [Doctrines of Salvation](https://lionandlambapologetics.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/JFS-Doctrines-of-Salvation-Volume-1.pdf) about having to accept Joseph Smith as a prophet.

- God used to be a man on another planet, (Mormon Doctrine, p. 321; Joseph Smith, Times and Seasons, vol. 5, p. 613-614; Orson Pratt, Journal of Discourses, vol. 2, p. 345; Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses, vol. 7, p. 333).

- God resides near a star called Kolob, (Pearl of Great Price, p. 34-35; Mormon Doctrine, p. 428).

- “The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man’s…” (Doctrines and Covenants 130:22).
