## More that 1 God
This is a response to the article [Mormonism is a Cult](https://carm.org/mormonism/is-mormonism-a-cult/)

"The Bible says there’s only one God in all existence (Isaiah 43:10; 44:6; 45:5), but Mormonism says there are many gods, (Mormon Doctrine, p. 163)"

So they say the Bible says there is only 1 God, but sources of LDS doctrine say there are multiple Gods. 

Isaiah 43:10

> Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me

Isaiah 44:6

> 6 Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, and his redeemer the Lord of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.

Isaiah 45:5

> 5 ¶ I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:

Abreham 4:3

> 3 And they (the Gods) said: Let there be light; and there was light.

I can't find the quote in [Doctrines of Salvation](https://lionandlambapologetics.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/JFS-Doctrines-of-Salvation-Volume-1.pdf) about having to accept Joseph Smith as a prophet.

- God used to be a man on another planet, (Mormon Doctrine, p. 321; Joseph Smith, Times and Seasons, vol. 5, p. 613-614; Orson Pratt, Journal of Discourses, vol. 2, p. 345; Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses, vol. 7, p. 333).

- God resides near a star called Kolob, (Pearl of Great Price, p. 34-35; Mormon Doctrine, p. 428).

- “The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man’s…” (Doctrines and Covenants 130:22).

- God is in the form of a man, (Joseph Smith, Journal of Discourses, vol. 6, p. 3).

- “God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and sits enthroned in yonder heavens!!! . . . We have imagined that God was God from all eternity. I will refute that idea and take away the veil, so that you may see,” (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p. 345).

- After you become a good Mormon, you have the potential of becoming a god, (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p. 345-347, 354).
There is a mother goddess, (Articles of Faith, by James Talmage, p. 443).
- God is married to his goddess wife and has spirit children, (Mormon Doctrine, p. 516).
- The Trinity is three separate Gods: The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. “That these three are separate individuals, physically distinct from each other, is demonstrated by the accepted records of divine dealings with man,” (Articles of Faith, by James Talmage, p. 35).
