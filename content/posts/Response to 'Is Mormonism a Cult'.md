## More that 1 God
This is a response to the article [Mormonism is a Cult](https://carm.org/mormonism/is-mormonism-a-cult/)

the Bible says thereâ€™s only one God in all existence (Isaiah 43:10; 44:6; 45:5), but Mormonism says there are many gods, (Mormon Doctrine, p. 163)

Isaiah 43:10

> Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me

Isaiah 44:6

> 6 Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, and his redeemer the Lord of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.
