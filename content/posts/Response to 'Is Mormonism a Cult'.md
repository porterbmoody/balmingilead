# Response

This is a response to the article [Mormonism is a Cult](https://carm.org/mormonism/is-mormonism-a-cult/)

## More that 1 God

"The Bible says there’s only one God in all existence (Isaiah 43:10; 44:6; 45:5), but Mormonism says there are many gods, (Mormon Doctrine, p. 163)"

So they say the Bible says there is only 1 God, but sources of LDS doctrine say there are multiple Gods. 

Isaiah 43:10

> Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me

Isaiah 44:6

> 6 Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, and his redeemer the Lord of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.

Isaiah 45:5

> 5 ¶ I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:

Abreham 4:3

> 3 And they (the Gods) said: Let there be light; and there was light.

I can't find the quote in [Doctrines of Salvation](https://lionandlambapologetics.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/JFS-Doctrines-of-Salvation-Volume-1.pdf) about having to accept Joseph Smith as a prophet.

## Nature of God

- God used to be a man on another planet, (Mormon Doctrine, p. 321; Joseph Smith, Times and Seasons, vol. 5, p. 613-614; Orson Pratt, Journal of Discourses, vol. 2, p. 345; Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses, vol. 7, p. 333).

Yes, Joseph Smith gave a discourse that explain that God was once a man like us now. This means we ourselves have potential to become like God. 

- God resides near a star called Kolob, (Pearl of Great Price, p. 34-35; Mormon Doctrine, p. 428).

Abreham 3:3 states:

> And the Lord said unto me: These are the governing ones; and the name of the great one is Kolob, because it is near unto me, for I am the Lord thy God: I have set this one to govern all those which belong to the same order as that upon which thou standest.
Yes, Abreham tells us that Kolob is the star near where God dwells. 

- “The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man’s…” (Doctrines and Covenants 130:22).

> 22 The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man’s; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us.

- God is in the form of a man, (Joseph Smith, Journal of Discourses, vol. 6, p. 3).

As I read through Joseph Smith's Journal of Discourses, vol. 6, p. 3, I am struggling to find the place where this doctrine is mentioned, "God is in the form of a man". However, I do find the following quote, 

> "I want to ask this congregation − every man, women, and child, to answer the question in their own heart, what kind of a being God is? Ask yourselves; turn your thoughts into your hearts, and say if any of you have seen, heard, or communed with him. This is a question that may occupy your attention for a long time. I again repeat the question − What kind of a being is God? Does any man or woman know? Have any of you seen him, heard him, or communed with him? Here is the question that will peradventure from this time henceforth occupy your attention."

I don't think this quote describes that God is in the form of a man. But There are verses and revelations Joseph Smith has recorded that God has a physical body which may be what this idea is referring to. 

- “God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and sits enthroned in yonder heavens!!! . . . We have imagined that God was God from all eternity. I will refute that idea and take away the veil, so that you may see,” (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p. 345).

- After you become a good Mormon, you have the potential of becoming a god, (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p. 345-347, 354).
- There is a mother goddess, (Articles of Faith, by James Talmage, p. 443).
- God is married to his goddess wife and has spirit children, (Mormon Doctrine, p. 516).
- The Trinity is three separate Gods: The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. “That these three are separate individuals, physically distinct from each other, is demonstrated by the accepted records of divine dealings with man,” (Articles of Faith, by James Talmage, p. 35).
