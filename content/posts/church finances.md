Several references to tithing are found in the scriptures. The same reference is included in Malachi 3

8 ¶ Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.

9 Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.

10 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.

and in 3 Nephi 24

8 Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say: Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.

9 Ye are cursed with a curse, for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.

10 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in my house; and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of Hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it.

Both references include a promise from the Lord that if we pay tithing, he will "open the windows of heaven, and pour out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive." This is quite a powerful promise. That means if we pay tithing we will be blessed with a blessing so big, we won't even be able to receive it. We see an occasion where Abraham is blessed with such a blessing that the Lord promises:

Genesis 7
11 ¶ In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.

Robert D. Hales said, "tithing is a test of faith with eternal blessings." 
and also said, "Tithing develops and tests our faith. By sacrificing to the Lord what we may think we need or want for ourselves, we learn to rely on Him."

Elder Hales also told us that some of the blessings of tithing are temporal, others are spiritual. 

We also see another reference when Jacob covenants to pay tithing.
Genesis 28
22 And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God’s house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.

In 1841 Joseph Smith was named as "trustee in trust" of church assets. The original structure under which all the legal assets where managed was a trust, not a corporation which eventually changed. 

In 1844 the management of church finances shifted to the quorum of the 12 apostles. 

1877 is when president Taylor organized the first audit commitee to oversee the management of church finances. 

1899 President Snow received the first revelation on tithing which rescued the church from dire financial circumstances.

1916 that the church started to operate under a corporation which is a kind of legal structure that starts with a board of directors. 

1923 the corportion of the first presidency and zions securities corporation were first created.

1959 the church ends practice of reporting financial details in general conference. Between 1915 and 1959 general details were reported. 

1963 president N Eldon Tanner was put directly into the first presidency. Partly because the church had overextended on chapel construction. President Tanner was asked to reign in church spending. 

1990 All local expenses were paid out of a general tithing fund. 

1991 Cost of LDS missions were equalized. 

1997 Ensign Peak was incorporated. This is the non profit that manages the majority of the church's financial holdings. 

1999 Church temple building accelerates dramatically. 

2013 The church first began publishing humanitarian aid reports. 

2019 Everything broke open with criticism and speculation. An IRS whistleblower report became public. 

The church has had ups and downs before President Tanner was ordained.
