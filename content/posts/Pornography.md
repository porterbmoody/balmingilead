## The Doctrine of Christ

When shortly after Jesus was resurrected, He visited the Nephites in North America. While teaching the doctrine of Christ, one commandment He reiterated was, 

> 27 Behold, it is written by them of old time, that thou shalt not commit aadultery;
> 
> [3 Nephi 12:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12?lang=eng&id=27#p27)

He then expounded on the commandment saying, 

> 28 But I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman, to alust after her, hath committed adultery already in his heart.
> 
> [3 Nephi 12:28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12?lang=eng&id=28#p28)


## The Solution

Here's a great quote from the talk from Brad Wilcox talk, "[Worthiness is not Flawlessness](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2021/10/35wilcox?lang=eng)"

> Considering how long Damon had struggled, it was unhelpful and unrealistic for parents and leaders assisting him to say “never again” too quickly or to arbitrarily set some standard of abstinence to be considered “worthy.” Instead, they started with small, reachable goals. They got rid of the all-or-nothing expectations and focused on incremental growth, which allowed Damon to build on a series of successes instead of failures.19 He, like the enslaved people of Limhi, learned he could “prosper by degrees.”
