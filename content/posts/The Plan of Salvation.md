# Creation

## Premortal Existence

Before we came to earth we all lived as souls with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ called premortal existence. There was a council where the Gods set forth a plan for all of God's children.

God created the earth, the plants, animals, mountains, oceans, seas. He set earth in motion around the sun. 

# Fall

## Adam and Eve

## Garden of Eden

After Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden, they were cast down to earth and fell and found themselves naked. So then the sewed fig leaves together and covered themselves. 

Genesis 2
> 7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.

Genesis 2
> 7 And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.

Genesis 3
> 21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.

There were 2 significant trees in the Garden of Eden. 1 was the tree of good and evil, the other was the tree of life. Adam and Eve were commanded not to partake of the fruit of the tree of good and evil. 

# Atonement

## Sufferings of Jesus Christ

Jesus Christ came to earth and suffered greatly for our sins. We read in Alma 7:11

> 11 And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.

Alma teaches us a little bit about what Jesus Christ felt in the Garden of Gethsemane. 

Moses 3 
> 16 And I, the Lord God, commanded the man, saying: Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat,
> 17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but, remember that I forbid it, for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.

Moses tells us that Adam and Eve were commanded not to partake of the tree of good and evil. If they do, they will "surely die". This teaches us they were commanded not to partake of the tree of good and evil, but they can partake of every other tree in the Garden of Eden.

Doctrine and Covenants 29

> 40 Wherefore, it came to pass that the devil tempted Adam, and he partook of the forbidden fruit and transgressed the commandment, wherein he became subject to the will of the devil, because he yielded unto temptation.
> 41 Wherefore, I, the Lord God, caused that he should be cast out from the Garden of Eden, from my presence, because of his transgression, wherein he became spiritually dead, which is the first death, even that same death which is the last death, which is spiritual, which shall be pronounced upon the wicked when I shall say: Depart, ye cursed.
We learn from the Doctrine and Covenants that the devil tempted Adam and Eve to break the commandment and partake of the fruit of the tree of good and evil. This caused them spiritual death and led to the fall where they were sent to earth. 

We also read in Moses 5

> 10 And in that day Adam blessed God and was filled, and began to prophesy concerning all the families of the earth, saying: Blessed be the name of God, for because of my transgression my eyes are opened, and in this life I shall have joy, and again in the flesh I shall see God.
Adam recognized certain blessings that could not have been realized without partaking of the fruit of the tree of good and evil and falling.

Ether 3:2

> for we know that thou art holy and dwellest in the heavens, and that we are unworthy before thee; because of the fall our natures have become evil continually;

The Brother of Jared tells us that because of the fall, we are unworthy before God. Our natures are naturally evil.
