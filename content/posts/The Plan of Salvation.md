# Creation

## Premortal Existence

Before we came to earth we all lived as souls with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ called premortal existence. There was a council where the Gods set forth a plan for all of God's children.

God created the earth, the plants, animals, mountains, oceans, seas. He set earth in motion around the sun. 

# Atonement

## Sufferings of Jesus Christ

Jesus Christ came to earth and suffered greatly for our sins. We read in Alma 7:11

> 11 And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.

Alma teaches us a little bit about what Jesus Christ felt in the Garden of Gethsemane.
