# Creation

## Premortal Existence

Before we came to earth we all lived as souls with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ called premortal existence. There was a council where the Gods set forth a plan for all of God's children.

God created the earth, the plants, animals, mountains, oceans, seas. He set earth in motion around the sun. 

# Fall

## Adam and Eve

## Garden of Eden

After Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden, they were cast down to earth and fell and found themselves naked. So then the sewed fig leaves together and covered themselves. 

> Genesis 2:7
> 7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.

> Genesis 2:7
> And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.

> Genesis 3:21
> 21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.

There were 2 significant trees in the Garden of Eden. 1 was the tree of good and evil, the other was the tree of life. Adam and Eve were commanded not to partake of the fruit of the tree of good and evil. 

# Atonement

## Sufferings of Jesus Christ

Jesus Christ came to earth and suffered greatly for our sins. We read in Alma 7:11

> 11 And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.

Alma teaches us a little bit about what Jesus Christ felt in the Garden of Gethsemane.
