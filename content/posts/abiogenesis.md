Here are the *most serious, still-unresolved scientific challenges* to the current theories of abiogenesis (as of 2025). These are the issues that keep origin-of-life researchers up at night — not creationist talking points, but real, peer-reviewed problems that the field openly acknowledges.

| # | Problem | Why it’s a big deal | Current status (2025) |
|---|---------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| 1 | *Prebiotic synthesis of usable nucleotides* | RNA-world needs decent yields of the four canonical ribonucleotides (A, G, C, U). The classic formose and cyanamide routes produce mostly junk; even the best modern pathways (Sutherland, Carell, Szostak groups) still require staged addition of reagents or purified intermediates that wouldn’t happen naturally in the same pond or vent. | Partial success in lab, but no single, geologically plausible pot that spits out all four in good purity and yield simultaneously. |
| 2 | *Chirality (homochirality)* | Life uses only L-amino acids and D-sugars. Prebiotic chemistry makes 50/50 racemic mixtures. A 50/50 mixture poisons most polymerization and self-replication chemistry. | Small enantiomeric excesses (5–20 %) can be produced by UV circularly polarized light, meteorites, or mineral surfaces, but *amplifying* that to >99 % purity without enzymes remains unsolved at scale. |
| 3 | *Concentration and the “water paradox”* | Peptide bonds, nucleotide polymerization, and lipid assembly are all *condensation reactions* that are thermodynamically uphill in water. You need high concentrations and a drying/wetting or dehydration mechanism. | Alkaline hydrothermal vents (Nick Lane model) or freeze-thaw cycles help, but no consensus mechanism that works for everything at once. |
| 4 | *Phosphorylation* | Getting phosphate onto sugars or nucleosides to make nucleotides is hard in water because phosphate is mostly bound up as insoluble apatite (Ca-phosphate). Free reactive phosphate was probably very scarce on early Earth. | Trimetaphosphate, diamidophosphate, and volcanic condensates show promise, but yields and stability are still marginal. |
| 5 | *The asphalt problem / side reactions* | Real prebiotic soups (Miller-Urey type) produce hundreds of organic compounds that cross-react to form tar and intractable goo, not clean polymers. | “Clean” pathways (cyanide derivatives, high-energy intermediates) avoid tar but require implausibly tidy conditions. |
| 6 | *Transition from prebiotic chemistry to Darwinian evolution* | We can make self-replicating ribozymes in the lab, but only with pure, hand-picked sequences. No one has a continuous pathway from random geochemical polymers to something capable of open-ended evolution. | Huge gap — the best replicating systems still lose information over generations without selection tricks engineered by humans. |
| 7 | *Membrane inheritance and protocell division* | Simple fatty-acid vesicles grow and divide, but they dilute their contents dramatically on division unless there’s a mechanism to couple nucleic-acid replication to membrane growth. | Some elegant experiments (Szostak, Deamer) show coupled growth, but only with carefully chosen lipids and nucleic acids — not yet robust under messy prebiotic conditions. |
| 8 | *Timescale and probability* | Even granting generous concentrations and pathways, some steps have extremely low yields. Critics (e.g., Tour, Hordijk) argue that the simultaneous co-occurrence of dozens of low-probability events in the same micro-environment strains plausibility on a 4-billion-year-old Earth. | Defenders counter with “sequential selection” and huge numbers of parallel trials on a planetary scale, but no rigorous calculation everyone agrees on. |

### Bottom line (honest assessment in 2025)

- We have *plausible, lab-demonstrated pathways for almost every individual step* (amino acids → peptides, sugars → nucleotides, lipids → vesicles, etc.).  
- We *do not yet have a single, continuous, geologically realistic scenario* that takes us from early Earth minerals to the first replicating, evolving protocells without invoking multiple “just-so” conditions or researcher intervention.

The field is making rapid progress (especially 2018–2025), but the hardest problems — homochirality, robust nucleotide supply, and the emergence of open-ended evolution — remain genuinely open. Abiogenesis is still the leading scientific hypothesis, but it is *not solved*, and anyone who says “we basically have it figured out” is overstating the case.
