Introduction
Stephen O. Smoot, John Gee, Kerry Muhlestein, and John S. Thompson
When we read the Book of Abraham with the reflection that its light
has burst upon the world after a silence of three or four thousand years,
during which it has slumbered in the bosom of the dead, and been
sealed up in the sacred archives of Egypt’s mouldering ruins; when we
see there unfolded our eternal being—our existence before the world
was—our high and responsible station in the councils of the Holy One,
and our eternal destiny; when we there contemplate the majesty of the
works of God as unfolded in all the simplicity of truth, opening to our
view the wide expanse of the universe, and shewing the laws and regulations, the times and revolutions of all the worlds, from the celestial
throne of heaven’s King, or the mighty Kolob, whose daily revolution is
a thousand years, down through all the gradations of existence to our
puny earth, we are lost in astonishment and admiration, and are led
to explain, what is man without the key of knowledge? or what can he
know when shut from the presence of his maker, and deprived of conversation with all intelligences of a higher order? Surely the mind of
man is just awaking from the deep sleep of many generations, from his
thousand years of midnight darkness.
—Parley P. Pratt (1842)1
The Book of Abraham is accepted by The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints as an inspired or revealed translation of the writings of the biblical patriarch Abraham.2 Joseph Smith began the translation of the text after he acquired some Egyptian papyrus scrolls and

mummies in summer 1835.3 Canonized as scripture by the Church in
1880,4 the book narrates an account of the patriarch’s near-sacrifice at
the hands of his idolatrous kinsfolk, his journey into Canaan, the covenant he entered into with God, and his visions of the premortal world
and the Creation. Although a short book of only five chapters, the Book
of Abraham has nevertheless contributed significantly to Restoration
doctrine, particularly as it pertains to the Latter-day Saint understanding of the Abrahamic covenant and the concept of the premortal existence of humankind.5
While Latter-day Saints cherish the Book of Abraham and accept
its inspiration on faith, they also have not been afraid to explore the
text with scholarly tools in order to better understand it. A pioneering
scholar of the Book of Abraham was Hugh Nibley (1910–2005), a former professor of religion at Brigham Young University with academic
training in ancient history and languages.6 Nibley wrote extensively

Press, 2019), 109–40.
6. A few of Nibley’s more noteworthy predecessors in Book of Abraham studies
include George Reynolds (1842–1909) and B. H. Roberts (1857–1933). Reynolds penned
a series of articles on the Book of Abraham in the late nineteenth century that argued for
its ancient authenticity and inspiration (see George Reynolds, “The Book of Abraham—
Its Genuineness Established,” published serially between January and April 1879 in The
Latter-day Saints’ Millennial Star 41, nos. 1–14, and republished as The Book of Abraham:
Its Authenticity Established as a Divine and Ancient Record, with Copious References to
Ancient and Modern Authorities [Salt Lake City: Deseret News, 1879]), while Roberts led
a spirited defense of the book when it came under scrutiny in the early twentieth century (see B. H. Roberts, “A Plea in Bar of Final Conclusions,” Improvement Era 16, no. 4
(February 1913): 309–25; B. H. Roberts, A Comprehensive History of the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints, 6 vols. [Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1930], 2:126–39).
As important as these two figures are in the history of Book of Abraham studies, however,
neither of them had the same degree of academic training as Nibley, and many of their
arguments are now very outdated. This is not to say they did not raise important questions and points to consider nor that their early contributions were unimportant, only
Introduction 7
on the Book of Abraham during his career, producing several important contributions to the scholarly discussion surrounding this book
of scripture.7 Since Nibley’s day, more scholars have turned their gaze
to the Book of Abraham from a number of different perspectives. The
results have been nothing short of remarkable. Scholars have profitably
evaluated the historical details of the text with Egyptological, archaeological, and linguistic tools; they have read its narrative closely to elucidate literary and poetic patterns; they have clarified its composition and
transmission history through textual criticism; and they have explored
the rich doctrine of the book. In addition to making compelling arguments for the historicity of the Book of Abraham, as well as its narrative
coherence and theological profundity, Nibley and other scholars have
also argued that elements of Joseph Smith’s interpretation of the three
facsimiles accompanying the text find plausible legitimacy as knowledge
of ancient Egypt and other ancient cultures has advanced.
A major obstacle to those who wish to study the Book of Abraham
more closely, however, is that this scholarship spans decades, is scattered throughout multiple venues (books, journals, videos, podcasts,
conference proceedings, and so forth), and is sometimes very technical.
This can make matters daunting for some Latter-day Saints who wish
to get a firm grasp on this material. To remedy this, in 2019 Book of
Mormon Central, a nonprofit research foundation dedicated to making
the Book of Mormon accessible, comprehensible, and defensible to the
entire world, launched an initiative called Pearl of Great Price Central
with the aim, in part, to collect, synthesize, and popularize scholarly
work on the Book of Abraham in order to provide study resources for
Latter-day Saints and others who wish to enhance their engagement
that Nibley exceeded them in terms of both quality and quantity and therefore rightly
deserves his place as the forefather of modern Book of Abraham scholarship.

with this book of scripture.8 In August 2019, Pearl of Great Price Central
launched a series of short essays called Book of Abraham Insights that
highlighted some of the more noteworthy convergences between the
Book of Abraham and the ancient world, explored how Joseph Smith’s
interpretations of the facsimiles in some ways harmonize with modern scholarship, and provided an overview on what is known about the
coming forth and translation of the Book of Abraham. The Insights were
kept deliberately short so as not to overwhelm readers with sometimes
technical and arcane information about ancient languages and cultures
while also remaining well-documented and rigorous and providing a
bibliography for those wanting to dive deeper into these matters.
In January 2020, Pearl of Great Price Central published its fortieth
Book of Abraham Insight before shifting attention to Joseph Smith—
History in the Pearl of Great Price in anticipation for the April 2020 general conference of the Church, which had been designated by President
Russell M. Nelson as a bicentennial celebration.9 It was at that time that
the authors of this present volume, who were the principal researchers
behind the Book of Abraham Insights on the Pearl of Great Price Central website, felt it was appropriate to revise the Insights and make them
available in print. Accordingly, the subsequent months of the year 2020
were spent revising the Insights to incorporate feedback from readers,
update material in response to advances in scholarship, take into consideration constructive critiques, expand some material that was at first
kept deliberately short, and include new material that could not appear
in the initial run of the Insights due to constraints in Pearl of Great Price
Central’s publishing schedule. With the kind assistance and cooperation
of John W. Welch and Steven C. Harper, the former and current editors of BYU Studies Quarterly, respectively, we are pleased to now find a
home for the final result of these revisions and expansions as an issue of
that journal.
As the name of this issue indicates, and in keeping with the original
purpose of Pearl of Great Price Central’s Book of Abraham Insightswhile
also building on it, our intention here is threefold: first, to introduce
readers to what the past decades of scholarship on the Book of Abraham
have already produced; second, to guide readers through trends in Book
of Abraham research currently unfolding; and third, to provide some

new insights into the Book of Abraham as examples of where future
scholarship can go. We hope, therefore, that we will have something of
value to offer readers from a variety of backgrounds—those already well
acquainted with Book of Abraham scholarship and those who may be
encountering this work for the first time. It is also for this reason that we
beg the reader’s pardon for indulging, at times, in rehashing previously
published work on the Book of Abraham, including our own, by extensively quoting ourselves and other scholars in ways that summarize and
distill past scholarship that may not always necessarily make new contributions to the discussion. Part of our goal with this issue, which we
have titled A Guide to the Book of Abraham, is to review what we already
know, and we do not wish to leave readers confused who are just now
encountering Book of Abraham scholarship, so we felt it not too inappropriate to recapitulate ourselves and others sometimes verbatim.
The content in this volume rearranges the organizational structure
that was first laid out on the Pearl of Great Price Central website in order
to create something of a more logical progression. The first section (“The
Coming Forth of the Book of Abraham”) gives an overview of the coming forth and translation of the Book of Abraham in the nineteenth century. The second section (“The Book of Abraham in the Ancient World”)
provides an ancient (including biblical) context for the Book of Abraham or otherwise touches on points related to the historicity of the text.
The third and final section (“The Facsimiles of the Book of Abraham”)
looks at the facsimiles and focuses on the more noteworthy instances
where Joseph Smith’s interpretations converge with modern Egyptological knowledge. These three interlocking issues are worthy of individual
review and consideration since how the reader evaluates one of them
will undoubtedly affect how he or she evaluates the other two.
Because each of us, the authors, has academic training in Egyptology and Near Eastern studies, we are conscientious of the balancing act
that comes with, as it were, “translating” academic jargon and technical language into a comprehensible dialect for nonacademic but interested lay readers. This includes how to transliterate ancient Egyptian
and other languages, which sometimes requires the use of characters
not found in the English alphabet. Because some of the arguments in
this book rely on careful analysis of the Egyptian language, we have followed standard Egyptological conventions of transliteration. We have
also grappled with how much to assume that our readers are familiar
with the ancient cultures we write about. We hope that we have struck
a proper balance between making our prose accessible and preserving

scholarly rigor or accuracy. For readers who are eager to get into the
technical aspects of the issues covered in this book, we advise they follow our footnotes and the recommendations for further reading at the
end of each article.
It is our sincere hope that A Guide to the Book of Abraham will equip
seekers and honest questioners with the best, most reliable scholarly
resources currently available and provide meaningful insights into
this extraordinary scriptural text. We hope that this work will serve as
a reliable guide as we look back to see how far we have come in our
understanding as well as look forward to pursue new scholarly lines of
inquiry that help us better understand the Book of Abraham in a variety
of contexts and thereby, we hope, also raise appreciation for this book
as sacred scripture and strengthen faith in Joseph Smith’s calling as a
modern seer and revelator.

What Egyptian Papyri
Did Joseph Smith Possess?
I
n early July 1835, Joseph Smith acquired some Egyptian papyri from
which he claimed to translate the Book of Abraham.1 From historical
evidence and the papyrus fragments that were returned to The Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in November 1967,2 we can piece
together a profile of what papyri the Prophet is known to have possessed.
The Book of Breathings of Hor (P. Joseph Smith I, X–XI)3
One of the texts that came into Joseph Smith’s ownership was a copy of
what is known today as the Book of Breathings—what the ancient Egyptians called the Sayt n snsn, translated variously as the “Document of
Breathing” or “Letter of Fellowship.”4 The purpose of this text, which the
Egyptians attributed to the goddess Isis (and so was called, in full, “The

Document of Breathing Made by Isis for Her Brother Osiris”; Sayt n snsn
ir=n Ist n sn=s Wsir), “was to provide the deceased with the essential
information needed to be resurrected from the dead and attain eternal life
with the gods in the hereafter.”5 Indeed, as the text itself explicitly says, its
purpose was to cause the deceased’s “soul to live, to cause his body to live,
to rejuvenate all his limbs . . . again, [so that he might join] the horizon
with his father, Re, [to cause his soul to appear in heaven as the disk of the
moon, so that his body might shine like Orion in the womb of Nut].”6
Today there are thirty-two known surviving copies of the Book of
Breathings Made by Isis.7 “While all extant copies of the . . . Document
of Breathing are very similar, no two are exactly identical.”8 The known
copies belonged almost exclusively to members of families of the priesthood of Amun-Re at the Karnak Temple in Thebes, “which suggests the
text might be particularly associated with that office.”9 The copy of this text
that Joseph Smith owned belonged anciently to an Egyptian priest named
Hor (1r) or Horos (in Greek) and is quite probably the oldest known copy
(dating to ca. 200 BC).10 Thanks to the work of Egyptologists since the
rediscovery of the Joseph Smith Papyri, we know quite a bit about Hor and
his occupation as a priest that has direct bearing on the Book of Abraham.11
The Book of the Dead of Tshemmin (P. Joseph Smith II–IX)
Another papyrus scroll that came into Joseph Smith’s possession was a
text owned anciently by a woman named Tshemmin (or Ta-Sherit-Min;

tA-Srit-[nt]-Mnw) or Semminis (her Greek name).12 “Semminis’s scroll
contained a Book of the Dead. Originally a very long scroll, it was greatly
reduced, and only fragmentary pieces ever reached Joseph Smith.”13 This
copy of the Book of the Dead dated to probably sometime during the
third to second century BC.14 The Book of the Dead is the name given
by modern Egyptologists to a collection of writings called by the ancient
Egyptians “Utterances of Coming Forth by Day” (rAw nw prt hrw).15
Among other purposes, this text “served as a protection for the bearer.
It describes its purpose as aiding the spirit in becoming exalted, ascending to and descending from the presence of the gods, and appearing as
whatever wanted, wherever wanted.”16 The Book of the Dead was a precursor to the Book of Breathings in the ancient Egyptian funerary tradition, and the latter seems to have generally but not entirely replaced the
former beginning in the Greco-Roman period (ca. 330–30 BC). Some
of the content and illustrations (or vignettes, as Egyptologists call them)
from the Book of the Dead were incorporated into the Book of Breathings, showing a relationship and dependence between the two texts.17
Although the Book of the Dead is often (and understandably)
referred to as a “funerary text,” Egyptologists now recognize that portions of this text were also used in non-funerary settings.18 For example,
the Book of the Dead had a connection to the ancient Egyptian temple
that may have significant implications for the Book of Abraham and for

the Latter-day Saint temple endowment.19 “The sections of Semminis’s
Book of the Dead in the Joseph Smith Papyri cover part of the introductory chapter, some of the texts dealing with Semminis’s being able to
appear as various birds or animals, texts allowing her to board the boat
of the supreme god and meet with the council of the gods, texts providing her with food and other good things and making her happy, and a
text asserting her worthiness to enter into the divine presence.”20
Previous scholarship on the Joseph Smith Papyri identified P. Joseph
Smith IIIa–b as belonging to a woman by the name of Neferirnub (nfrir-nbw).21 It was supposed that the female owner of this papyrus fragment, which “shows the deceased standing before [the god] Osiris with
her heart being weighed in scales,”22 was someone other than Tshemmin and that therefore Joseph Smith possessed two different copies of
the Book of the Dead belonging to two different women. As was demonstrated in 2019, however, Neferirnub was a nickname for Tshemmin,
and thus, the two were the same woman. P. Joseph Smith II, IV–IX and
P. Joseph Smith IIIa–b belonged to the same scroll.23
The portion of the Book of the Dead previously assigned as P. Joseph
Smith IIIa–b, commonly designated Spell or Chapter 125 by Egyptologists, was being used in Egyptian temples by the time of the creation of
the Joseph Smith Papyri.24 It was also being used in the initiation and
purification rituals of Egyptian priests.25 Interestingly, in 1835 Oliver

What Egyptian Papyri Did Joseph Smith Possess? 17
Cowdery described the scene portrayed in this fragment as the judgment of the dead.26
The Scroll of Amenhotep (“Valuable Discovery”)27
Another papyrus roll that Joseph Smith owned belonged to a man named
Amenhotep (Imn-Htp).28 Unfortunately, the original papyrus containing
this text is not extant. It is only known from a nineteenth-century copy
in the handwriting of Oliver Cowdery and appears, based on the reading
of one Egyptologist, to be portions of a copy of the Book of the Dead.29
Because only a few lines of hieratic Egyptian characters were copied
(enough to give us the name of the owner of the papyrus and perhaps a
sense of what it contained, but not much more), the dating of this papyrus is unknown.
The Hypocephalus of Sheshonq (Facsimile 2)
Finally, Joseph Smith owned a hypocephalus that anciently belonged
to a man named Sheshonq or Shishak (ššḳ).30 This hypocephalus was
published on March 15, 1842, in the Times and Seasons as Facsimile 2 of
the Book of Abraham.31 Unfortunately, the original hypocephalus is not
extant. However, because this type of document is rare and belonged
primarily to a select group of Egyptian priests and their family members,
we can date Sheshonq’s hypocephalus to sometime during the Ptolemaic

text is in the hand of Oliver Cowdery, and, in the judgment of Jensen and Hauglid, it
is “likely” that so are the hieratic characters. See Jensen and Hauglid, Revelations and

volume.33
It should be remembered that this Egyptian material is what we currently know Joseph Smith possessed. It is possible, and indeed likely,
that Joseph Smith possessed more papyri than have survived. Eyewitness accounts of those who viewed the papyri during Joseph Smith’s lifetime suggest a substantial portion of papyri is no longer extant.34 What
may have been contained on the portion of missing papyrus (including,
potentially, a copy of what modern readers would identify as the Book of
Abraham) and exactly how much papyrus is missing are open questions
that scholars are still investigating and debating.35

Multiple sources associated with the coming forth of the Book of
Abraham spoke of Joseph Smith “translating” the text from the
papyri he acquired.1 The Prophet himself used this language to describe
his own activity with the text. For example, an entry in his journal under
the date November 19, 1835, indicates the Prophet “spent the day in
translating” the Egyptian records.2 In an unpublished editorial that was
apparently meant to be printed in the March 1, 1842, issue of the Times
and Seasons (the issue that saw the publication of the first installment of
the Book of Abraham), Joseph Smith signaled his desire to “contin[u]e
to translate & publish [the text] as fast as possible [until] the whole is
completed.”3 What was published with the Book of Abraham was a

preface announcing it as “A Translation Of some ancient Records that
have fallen into our hands . . . purporting to be the writings of Abraham.”4
On at least one occasion shortly after its publication, Joseph Smith
described the Book of Abraham as a “revelation” instead of a translation.5 This raises a question about what these words may have meant to
the Prophet and what he may have thought about the nature of the text
of the Book of Abraham that he produced. There are plenty of instances
where Joseph used the word “translation” to mean utilizing available
scholarly tools to convert an ancient language into modern English. This,
for example, is how he used the term when studying Hebrew, which he
learned from a teacher using a grammar book and dictionary.6 However,
as with the Book of Mormon, sources indicate that Joseph professed
that the translation of the Book of Abraham came by revelation and the
gift and power of God. So, while Joseph appears to have used the word
“translation” to describe the Book of Abraham as meaning the conversion
of an ancient text into modern English, the means or methods he used to
accomplish this translation were uncommon by conventional academic
standards—namely, revelation. This is similar to what Joseph said about
his efforts to render other ancient scriptural texts into English throughout his ministry. A review of the different texts he produced and how
he produced them, therefore, appears relevant to how we might better
understand the nature of the translation of the Book of Abraham.7

How Did Joseph Smith Translate the Book of Abraham? 31
The Book of Mormon
Joseph Smith’s signature work of scripture is the Book of Mormon,
which the Prophet claimed to have translated from ancient gold plates
“by the gift, and power of God.”8 While early efforts to decipher the
“reformed Egyptian” (Morm. 9:32) characters on the plates evidently did
involve some mental effort by the Prophet and his scribes,9 ultimately
the translation was revealed through the use of divinely prepared seer
stones.10 Because we benefit from multiple eyewitness accounts of those
who participated in the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, we have
a fairly good understanding of how it was produced. “When Joseph
Smith began translating the Book of Mormon in 1827, he usually left the
plates in a box or wrapped in a cloth, placed the [Nephite] interpreters or his seer stone (both of which seem to have been called Urim and
Thummim) in a hat, and read the translation he saw in the stone to a
scribe.”11 All of this suggests that Joseph Smith’s mechanism for translating the Book of Mormon, while still conveying one language (Egyptian
or Hebrew) to another (English), was more closely synonymous with
revelation.12 “This sacred ancient record was not ‘translated’ in the traditional way that scholars would translate ancient texts by learning an
ancient language. We ought to look at the process more like a ‘revelation’
with the aid of physical instruments provided by the Lord, as opposed to
a ‘translation’ by one with knowledge of languages.”13

The Parchment of John (Doctrine and Covenants 7)
Section 7 of the Doctrine and Covenants was received by Joseph Smith
and Oliver Cowdery in April 1829 just before or during the time when
Oliver acted as a scribe for the translation of the Book of Mormon.14
When this section was first published in the Book of Commandments in
1833, it was described as “a Revelation given to Joseph and Oliver” and
was said to have been “translated from parchment, written and hid up
by” a figure named John (presumably the beloved disciple).15 This same
description was given when the text was republished in 1835 and 1842
under the supervision of Joseph Smith.16
This revealed “translation” of John’s record was received, like the Book
of Mormon, through divine instruments (the Urim and Thummim).17 It
is important to remember that during this process Joseph Smith “did not
have physical possession of the papyrus [of John] he was translating.”18

when this section was republished in the 1835 first edition of the Doctrine and Covenants, it had been revised and expanded from its initial
form as it appeared in the 1833 Book of Commandments, indicating that
expansion and revision could be included in the scope of Joseph’s work
as a translator.19
The “New Translation” of the Bible
Another important effort undertaken by Joseph Smith was what he
called a “new translation” of the Bible (see D&C 37:1; 45:60–61; 73:3–4;
93:53).20 Undertaken principally between June 1830 and July 1833, this
“new translation” of the Bible (today called the Joseph Smith Translation or JST) was not accomplished by the Prophet carefully scrutinizing
Hebrew and Greek manuscripts with the aid of a grammar and lexicon,
nor even, apparently, by consulting his seer stone or the Urim and Thummim. Rather, Joseph revised the English text of the King James Version
of the Bible by inspiration.21 That revelation specifically was understood
to be Joseph’s method in producing this new translation of the Bible is
indicated by both evidence from the original JST manuscripts and the
recollections of at least one source who claimed to be an eyewitness to
the process.22 With language similar to how Joseph Smith described the

to Moses 1), “A Revelation given to the Elders of the Church of Christ On the first Book

translation of the Book of Mormon, a superscription in the original dictated manuscript of JST Matthew explicitly designates the text “A Translation of the New Testament translated by the power of God.”23
Even though Joseph was revising the English text of the KJV and
sometimes revealing entirely new content (such as much of what is
today called the book of Moses in the Pearl of Great Price), he nevertheless called the project a translation. It is possible that part of the process
of revising some portions of the text of the JST involved Joseph consulting a popular biblical commentary, although the extent of this influence
on the JST is debatable.24 While it is arguable that some of Joseph Smith’s
revisions to the KJV Bible convey a more precise reading of the underlying Greek and Hebrew, or that other portions revealed by the Prophet in
some way correspond to nonextant ancient manuscripts, a broader view
of the types of revisions he made to the Bible suggests that he was doing
more with his translation than just rendering ancient languages.25

been driven out of the garden of Eden” (preface to Moses 5/Genesis 4). See “Old Testament Revision 1,” [1], 3, 8, Joseph Smith Papers, accessed December 13, 2022, https://www
.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/old-testament-revision-1/3. Many years after
the project was finished, Orson Pratt recalled witnessing Joseph Smith dictate his revisions to the Bible while under the inspiration of God. “He was inspired of God to translate the Scriptures,” wrote Pratt in 1856, speaking of the JST. Orson Pratt, “Spiritual Gifts”
(n.p., 1856), 71. A few years later, Pratt said in a sermon how he “saw [Joseph Smith’s]
countenance lighted up as the inspiration of the Holy Ghost rested upon him, dictating
the great and most precious revelations now printed for our guide.” Pratt specifically
remembered seeing Joseph “translating, by inspiration, the Old and New Testaments,
and the inspired book of Abraham from Egyptian papyrus.” Orson Pratt, in Journal of
Discourses, 26 vols. (Liverpool: F. D. Richards, 1855–86), 7:176 (July 10, 1859). That Pratt
mentioned the JST and the Book of Abraham together may be significant in how Joseph
Smith’s contemporaries understood and contextualized these two scriptural productions.

The Record of John (D&C 93:6–18)
Although not typically thought of as a translation since it is embedded
in a longer revelation received by the Prophet on May 6, 1833, it could be
reasonably argued that the “record of John” in Doctrine and Covenants
93:6–18 is in fact another translated text and should be included among
Joseph Smith’s scriptural translation projects.26 Like the Parchment of
John (D&C 7), this portion of Doctrine and Covenants 93 quotes a figure named John (once again presumably the beloved disciple, but possibly John the Baptist27) in the first person and promises that “if [readers]
are faithful [they] shall receive the fulness of the record of John” (v. 18;
compare v. 6). “Section 93 draws on otherwise lost writings of John,”
recognizes one scholar. “It is clear that the revelation restores tantalizing lost texts and promises that even more will be forthcoming.”28 Little
is known about the circumstances surrounding the reception of this
section.29 It is clear that it was received in the context of the Prophet’s
work of translating the Bible,30 but it is unknown if Joseph used the seer
stone to see and restore (“translate”) these words from John. There is no
evidence that Joseph was physically handling any ancient manuscripts
when he received this revelation and rendered these words from John.
Whatever the case, this “revelation was bold and new, yet also ancient
and familiar. As with so many of Joseph Smith’s revelations, it recovered
lost truths that were apparently known to biblical figures.”31
restoring original text, restoring things said or done but never recorded in the Bible,
modernizing the language of the Bible, harmonizing biblical passages with themselves
or with modern revelation, and “common sense” revising to correct errors. These are in
addition to a number of other possibilities, which include instances of the Prophet, by
revelation, giving more precise renderings of the original languages. See also Matthews,
“Plainer Translation,” 253; and Scott H. Faulring, Kent P. Jackson, and Robert J. Matthews,

How Did Joseph Smith Translate the Book of Abraham? 37
The Book of Abraham
This brings us to the Book of Abraham, the translation of which must
be viewed within the broader context of Joseph Smith’s other scriptural
translations. When it comes to the nature of the translation of the Book
of Abraham, there is not much direct evidence for how Joseph Smith
accomplished the work. “No known first-person account from Joseph
Smith exists to explain the translation of the Book of Abraham, and the
scribes who worked on the project and others who claimed knowledge
of the process provided only vague or general reminiscences.”32 John
Whitmer, then acting as the Church’s historian and recorder, commented
that “Joseph the Seer saw these Record[s] and by the revelation of Jesus
Christ could translate these records, . . . which when all translated will
be a pleasing history and of great value to the saints.”33 Another important source is Warren Parrish, one of the scribes who assisted Joseph in
the production of the Book of Abraham. After his disaffection from the
Church in 1837, Parrish reported that in his capacity as Joseph’s scribe he
“penned down the translation of the Egyptian Hieroglyphicks as [Joseph]
claimed to receive it by direct inspiration from Heaven.”34 Although no
longer a believer at the time he composed his letter, Parrish’s statement,
like Whitmer’s, emphasizes that Joseph’s claimed method of his “translation of the Egyptian Hieroglyphicks” was revelatory, not academic, but
also that the Prophet was still claiming to perform a translation of an
ancient language. Unfortunately, Parrish did not elaborate further on
the precise nature of this translation “by direct inspiration,” although his
statement does, intriguingly, echo the language Oliver Cowdery used to
describe the translation of the Book of Mormon.35
Other sources reported that the Prophet used the Urim and Thummim or a seer stone in the translation of the Book of Abraham.36 A hostile

called ‘The Book of Mormon.’” Oliver Cowdery, “Dear Brother,” Latter Day Saints’ Messenger and Advocate 1, no. 1 (October 1834): 14, emphasis in original.

newspaper, the Cleveland Whig, relayed in August 1835, “We are credibly
informed that the Mormons have purchased of Mr. Chandler, three of
the mummies, which he recently exhibited in this village; and that the
prophet Joe has . . . examin[ed] the papyrus through his spectacles,”
meaning most likely his seer stone, since there is no evidence that the
angel Moroni returned the Urim and Thummim (the Nephite “Interpreters”) to Joseph Smith after 1829. The source named by the Cleveland Whig
for this claim appears to have been Frederick G. Williams, who was a
scribe in the translation of the Book of Abraham, and who, according
to the paper, was “travelling about the country” with “this shallow and
contemptible story.”37 Because this newspaper’s report is early and names
a source close to Joseph Smith, it “should [at least] be taken seriously.”38
But at the same time, because it is thirdhand and hostile, it must be also
accepted cautiously. Friendly sources close to Joseph later reported the
use of a seer stone in the translation.39 With the exception of Wilford
Woodruff, who helped prepare the Book of Abraham for publication in
1842,40 these sources were not immediately involved in the production
of the text, and in one instance may have been confusing the translation
process of the Book of Abraham with the translation process of the Book

translate. Howard Coray to Martha Jane Lewis, August 2, 1889, MS 3047, Church History Catalog, https://catalog.churchofjesuschrist.org/assets/becd2d14-e7c0-4aa8-b70d

clerk until 1840, he could not have witnessed the translations of the Book of Mormon or
the Bible. It would appear that, unless he meant he saw Joseph receive revelation by the
seer stone, he witnessed Joseph on at least one occasion in Nauvoo translate a portion of
the Egyptian papyri with the seer stone.

of Mormon.41 As with the early report in the Cleveland Whig, they too
should be considered seriously but accepted cautiously. If Joseph did
use a seer stone in the translation of the Book of Abraham, this would
reinforce the point that the method of translation for the Prophet was
unique.
Clues from the Book of Abraham text suggest that the Prophet felt
free to continually adapt and revise his initial translation. For example,
some of the names of the characters in the Book of Abraham were
revised in 1842 shortly before its publication.42 Likewise, Joseph Smith’s
study of Hebrew appears to have also influenced the final form of the
text, because his knowledge of such evidently influenced how he either
initially rendered or later revised certain words and phrases in the Book
of Abraham’s creation account.43 One of the glosses at the beginning of
41. The account in the Friends’ Weekly Intelligencer, cited above, reads thus: “When
Joseph was reading the papyrus, he closed his eyes, and held a hat over his face, and that
the revelation came to him; and that where the papyrus was torn, he could read the parts
that were destroyed equally as well as those that were there; and that scribes sat by him
writing, as he expounded.” The detail of Joseph placing his face into his hat to read the
papyrus sounds much like how witnesses described the translation of the Book of Mormon, suggesting the possibility that the paper misreported or confused which text Lucy
Mack Smith was describing. On the other hand, if the Cleveland Whig report is accurate
and Joseph was indeed examining the papyrus with his seer stone, then perhaps Joseph’s
translation methods for the Book of Mormon and the Book of Abraham were more similar than previously supposed. Furthermore, at least two other sources also indicate that
Joseph was able to read and translate portions of the papyrus that were damaged. One of
these sources mentions how “Smith is to translate the whole by divine inspiration, and
that which is lost, like Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, can be interpreted as well as that which
is preserved” (William S. West, A Few Interesting Facts Respecting the Mormons [n.p.,
1837], 5), while the other speaks of how the Prophet “translated the characters on the roll,
being favored with a ‘special revelation’ whenever any of the characters were missing
by reason of mutilation of the roll” (Frederic G. Mather, “The Early Days of Mormonism,” Lippincott’s Magazine of Popular Literature and Science 2, no. 6 [August 1880]: 211).
These accounts are in harmony with that published in the Friends’ Weekly Intelligencer
but must also be accepted cautiously since they are hearsay.

the book (“which signifies hieroglyphics”; Abr. 1:14) is not present in the
Kirtland-era manuscripts, which appears to indicate that it came from
Joseph Smith or one of his scribes at the time of the publication of the
text.44 Another gloss (“I will refer you to the representation at the commencement of this record”;45 Abr. 1:12) was inserted interlineally, suggesting that “the references to the facsimiles within the text of the Book
of Abraham seem to have been nineteenth-century editorial insertions,”46
although this is not the only interpretation of this data point.47 It should
not come as a surprise that Joseph Smith (or his scribes) made revisions
to the English text of the Book of Abraham and still called it a translation, since he also revised his revelations that comprise the Doctrine and
Covenants and the Book of Mormon in subsequent editions after their
initial publication.48
Whatever Joseph’s precise method of scriptural translation, which he
specified only as being “by the gift and power of God,” more important is
what he produced. As Hugh Nibley recognized, “The Prophet has saved us
the trouble of faulting his method by announcing in no uncertain terms
that it is a method unique to himself depending entirely on divine revelation. That places the whole thing beyond the reach of direct examination
and criticism but leaves wide open the really effective means of testing
any method, which is by the results it produces.”49 The results of Joseph
Smith’s inspired translations are books of scripture that appear beyond his
natural ability to produce.
A fuller grasp of this fascinating and important subject therefore
includes appreciating how Joseph Smith and other early Latter-day

232, have sought to broaden the definition of “translation” in Joseph Smith’s parlance to
effectively equate it with pure revelation, with the end result basically divorcing the text
of the Book of Abraham, in this instance, from any relationship with a purported ancient
manuscript. For a review and engagement with Givens’s work, see John S. Thompson,
“‘We May Not Understand Our Words’: The Book of Abraham and the Concept of Translation in The Pearl of Greatest Price,” Interpreter: A Journal of Latter-day Saint Faith

54, no. 3 (Fall 2021): 1–39, has written on what he sees is the “incommensurability” of
translation in Joseph Smith’s thinking, meaning the process of translation ultimately
remains inaccessible and indescribable by conventional means and thereby eludes our
full understanding.

The “Kirtland Egyptian Papers” and the
Book of Abraham
Associated with the translation of the Book of Abraham is a collection of
documents commonly known today as the “Kirtland Egyptian
Papers.”1 This name was coined by Hugh Nibley in the early 1970s to
describe a corpus of manuscripts that can be classified into, broadly, two
categories: Book of Abraham manuscripts and Egyptian-language manuscripts (or manuscripts that “focus on alphabet and grammar material that
the authors connected to the ancient Egyptian language”).2 Because some
of these documents postdate the Kirtland period of Latter-day Saint history,
and because the name coined by Nibley to describe this corpus is somewhat
vague, the name has fallen out of general use among scholars, who prefer
more precise classifications. Regardless of what people today call them,
“the[se] name designations are modern ones and typically reflect assumptions of the individuals using the particular designations. No [single] designation [to describe these texts] has gained wide acceptance.”3
The Book of Abraham manuscripts among the Kirtland Egyptian
Papers contain multiple copies of the extant English text of the Book of
Abraham. These manuscripts date from mid-1835 to early 1842 and are in

the handwriting of W. W. Phelps, Warren Parrish, Frederick G. Williams,
and Willard Richards.4 The Egyptian-language manuscripts comprise an
assortment of documents, some of which contain transcriptions of portions of the characters from the Egyptian papyri and associate them with
English words and phrases, including passages from the Book of Abraham.
These documents are in the handwriting of W. W. Phelps, Joseph Smith,
Oliver Cowdery, Frederick G. Williams, and Warren Parrish.5 While these
two groups can be broadly distinguished, “it should also be understood that
the Abraham documents contain a certain amount of Egyptian material
and the Egyptian papers include a certain amount of Abraham material.”6
Because of this, it is clear that there is some kind of relationship between
these two groups, though the nature of that relationship is not entirely clear.
Because of conflicting interpretations of the historical data among
scholars, the meaning, purpose, and significance of these documents is
disputed. Even some basic details about this corpus remain disputed.
This includes “their authorship, their date, their purpose, their relationship with the Book of Abraham, their relationship with the Joseph Smith
Papyri, their relationship with each other, what the documents are or were
intended to be, and even whether the documents form a discrete or coherent group.”7 This uncertainty has unfortunately resulted in a lack of consensus on how to understand this collection.
The Egyptian-language documents among the Kirtland Egyptian
Papers can be plausibly viewed as a sincere but misguided attempt by
those involved to understand the Egyptian language in conjunction
with the divinely revealed translation of the Book of Abraham. As with
other “efforts of the time to unravel the mysteries of the Egyptian language, these attempts are considered by modern Egyptologists—both
Latter-day Saints and others—to be of no actual value in understanding [the] Egyptian” language.8 Because of this, some have attempted to
use the Egyptian-language documents to cast doubt on Joseph Smith’s

prophetic inspiration or the authenticity of the Book of Abraham. These
efforts, however, are highly questionable for a number of reasons and
generally demonstrate an exercise in religious polemics rather than critical scholarship.
First, the simple fact is that “the extent of Joseph Smith’s involvement
in the creation of these manuscripts is unknown.”9 It is true that he had
some involvement in the project since his handwriting appears in one
manuscript, and his signature on another.10 His manuscript history also
contains a reference to his involvement with the project: “The remainder
of this month [July 1835], I was continually engaged in translating an
alphabet to the Book of Abraham, and arrangeing [sic] a grammar of
the Egyptian language as practiced by the ancients.”11 However, this is
insufficient reason to conclude that Joseph Smith was the primary agent
behind the effort to create the Egyptian-language documents.12

12. For one thing, although this entry in Joseph Smith’s manuscript history is dated
to July 1835 and written as though it comes directly from the Prophet, this comment is, in
fact, a retrospective entry that was composed and inserted into the history by clerk Willard
Richards no earlier than September 1843. Indeed, it could be that the entry comes not from
Joseph Smith at all, but rather from his ghostwriter W. W. Phelps (compare Samuel Brown,
“The Translator and the Ghostwriter: Joseph Smith and W. W. Phelps,” Journal of Mormon
History 34, no. 1 [2008]: 26–62), in whose hand the “Grammar and Alphabet of the Egyptian Language” (GAEL) volume is composed (see “Grammar and Alphabet of the English
Language, circa July–circa November 1835,” Joseph Smith Papers, https://www.josephsmith
papers.org/paper-summary/grammar-and-alphabet-of-the-egyptian-language-circa-july
-circa-november-1835/7). It must also not be forgotten that “although various people acted
as scribe to Joseph Smith, they were independent people and had their own independent
thoughts. Not everything written by one of Joseph Smith’s scribes came from the mind
of Joseph Smith, even during the time period when they served as Joseph Smith’s scribes.”
John Gee, “Joseph Smith and Ancient Egypt,” in Blumell, Grey, and Hedges, Approaching
Antiquity, 437. A cryptic note in Joseph Smith’s Nauvoo-era journal further complicates
matters. An entry dated November 15, 1843, reads, “P.M. at the office. Suggested the Idea
of preparing a grammar of the Egyptian Language.” Andrew H. Hedges, Alex D. Smith,
and Brent M. Rogers, eds., Journals, Volume 3: May 1843–June 1844, Joseph Smith Papers
(Salt Lake City: Church Historian’s Press, 2015), 130. What could this mean? Possibilities
include, but are not limited to, either that the Prophet wanted to do further work on the
GAEL, assuming he participated in its production, that he wanted to prepare the same for
publication, or that he did not agree with the content of the GAEL and wanted to undertake
an entirely different approach. See Hedges, Smith, and Rogers, eds., Journals, Volume 3, 130

Second, it remains as yet “unclear when in 1835 Joseph Smith began creating the existing Book of Abraham manuscripts or what relationship the
Book of Abraham manuscripts have to the Egyptian-language documents.”13
Third, while “considerable overlap of themes exists between the
Book of Abraham and the Egyptian-language documents, . . . most of
the Book of Abraham is not textually dependent on any of the extant
Egyptian-language documents. The inverse is also true: most of the content in the Egyptian-language documents is independent of the Book of
Abraham.”14
Fourth, and finally, the Egyptian-language documents were never
presented as authoritative revelation. “What emerges most clearly from
a closer look at the Kirtland Egyptian Papers,” observed Nibley in his
pioneering study, “is the fact that there is nothing official or final about
them—they are fluid, exploratory, confidential, and hence free of any
possibility or intention of fraud or deception.”15 With this in mind, the
Egyptian-language documents might be understood as part of “an interest in ancient languages within the early church and an anticipation that
additional ancient texts would be revealed.”16 This interest prompted
Joseph Smith and those close to him to attempt a secular study of other
ancient languages such as Hebrew and Greek,17 and the Egyptianlanguage project could perhaps be situated in this same context.
There is still much that we do not know about the Kirtland Egyptian
Papers, including the precise circumstances surrounding their creation
and purpose. While their ultimate nature remains debated, recent scholarship has called into question older assumptions and arguments about
the extent of Joseph Smith’s participation in the Egyptian-language
n. 576; and Gee, Introduction to the Book of Abraham, 37. In any case, it complicates how to
understand Joseph Smith’s role in the composition of the Kirtland-era Egyptian language
GAEL document.

In the meantime, what can be safely concluded is that “although we have
incomplete information on exactly how the Book of Abraham was translated, the resulting contents of that translation are more important than
the process itself.”19

The Relationship between the Book of
Abraham and the Joseph Smith Papyri
I
t is clear that Joseph Smith’s inspired translation of the Book of Abraham was connected to the Egyptian papyri he acquired in summer
1835. However, less clear is the precise relationship between the Book of
Abraham text and the papyri. “Several theories posit ways in which the
Book of Abraham text relates to the papyri. The Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints maintains that Joseph Smith translated the Book of
Abraham from papyri, but they do not specify which papyri. Theories
about the relationship may be categorized under three heads: Joseph
Smith produced the Book of Abraham (1) from the fragments of papyri
that we still have, (2) from papyri that we no longer have, or (3) without
the aid of any of the Joseph Smith Papyri.”1
Exploring these theories individually reveals that while they each
have some evidence for them, “not all of the theories account equally for
the historical evidence. It is [also] worth knowing some of the problems
associated with the various theories. Whichever theory one chooses to
follow, one must be prepared to deal with the problems posed by the
evidence that the theory cannot account for.”2
Theory 1: Joseph Smith translated the Book of Abraham from the
extant papyri fragments.
The proponents of this theory maintain that Joseph Smith either pretended to translate or mistakenly thought he was translating the Book of
Abraham from the surviving fragments of the Hor Book of Breathings

Center, Brigham Young University; Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2017), 83.

The Relationship between the Book of Abraham and the Joseph Smith Papyri 51
(P. Joseph Smith I, XI+X).3 The two main pieces of evidence cited by
proponents of this theory are (1) the hieratic Egyptian characters from
the Book of Breathings (P. Joseph Smith XI) that appear in the margins
of the early Book of Abraham manuscripts and (2) the proximity of the
original vignette for Facsimile 1 at the beginning of the Hor Book of
Breathings and the apparent reference to this illustration in the Book
of Abraham text claiming it is “at the commencement of this record”
(Abr. 1:12, 14).4 At first glance, these two pieces of evidence may appear
persuasive, but other scholars have disputed their explanatory power in
connecting the English text of the Book of Abraham to the text in the
surviving fragments.
For example, there is evidence that casts doubt on whether any of the
existing Book of Abraham manuscripts is the original manuscript. With
respect to the extant manuscript copies of the Book of Abraham, it is not
clear who placed the hieratic characters from the Book of Breathings in
the margins or when they were added. It is also not clear what the scribe
was thinking when he added the characters. It has been widely assumed
that they were copied at Joseph Smith’s direct prompting during the process of translation, but this is not certain.5

Givens with Brian M. Hauglid, The Pearl of Greatest Price: Mormonism’s Most Controversial Scripture (New York: Oxford University Press, 2019), 109–222. Latter-day Saints who
accept this theory tend to separate what they see as the inspired revelation Joseph Smith
received that produced the text of the Book of Abraham with his mistaken assumption
about the source of that text. In this way of thinking, the Prophet’s divine inspiration must
be compartmentalized with his own natural assumptions, which may or may not be true.

“Though the juxtaposition of the characters and Book of Abraham
text implies a relationship between the two, the exact nature of that relationship is not stated” and is complicated by the evidence that the manuscripts which bear these marginal characters appear to be copies of an
earlier text that is no longer extant.6 Any assumed relationship between
the two remains an assumption.
The second point of evidence (the reference to Facsimile 1 at Abr.
1:12, 14) is likewise more complicated than is often supposed. For starters, scholars have recognized that the last line of Abraham 1:12 (“I will
refer you to the representation at the commencement of this record”)
and all of Abraham 1:14 (“That you may have an understanding of these
gods, I have given you the fashion of them in the figures at the beginning,
which manner of figures is called by the Chaldeans Rahleenos, which signifies hieroglyphics”) are interlinear insertions in the earliest manuscript
copy of the Book of Abraham.7 Even if one assumes these references
were original and not added later, this does not fully explain what these
verses mean. While the text does seem to say that the vignette is adjacent
to it, it could, alternatively, be read as indicating “that the vignette depicting the altar and idols is not adjacent to the text but some distance from
it.”8 A phrase such as “at the beginning” or “at the commencement” could
be referring to something one sentence or ten paragraphs away.
Theory 2: Joseph Smith translated the Book of Abraham from a
missing papyrus fragment.
This theory has gained traction as scholars have looked more closely at
nineteenth-century eyewitness descriptions of the papyrus believed to
be the source of the Book of Abraham. “The nineteenth-century eyewitnesses, both Mormon and non-Mormon, favorable and hostile to
the Church, agree that the Book of Abraham was translated from a long
roll of papyrus that was still a long roll in the 1840s and 1850s. The current fragments of the Joseph Smith Papyri, however, were all mounted
on heavy paper and placed in glass frames in 1837. None of them can

be the long roll described in the 1840s and 1850s. So these fragments
are specifically not the source of the Book of Abraham according to the
eyewitnesses.”9
The main advantage to this theory is that it can better account for the
nineteenth-century eyewitness evidence. It also answers the objections
raised by those who rightly point out that none of the surviving Joseph
Smith Papyri fragments translate as the Book of Abraham. However, this
theory has been criticized on the grounds that while there are indeed
missing portions of papyri (for example, Facsimiles 2 and 3 are no longer extant), it is questionable whether there is enough missing papyrus
to accommodate a hypothetical Book of Abraham text.10 In addition,
even though “this theory accounts for [the eyewitness] evidence,” it is
still “frustrating to many people. Because the papyri are no longer extant,
there is no possible way to check Joseph Smith’s translation of the Book
of Abraham.”11
Theory 3: Joseph Smith translated the Book of Abraham by
revelation but not from the papyri he possessed.
This theory argues that the Book of Abraham was not on the papyri that
Joseph Smith possessed but that he translated it merely by pondering
over the papyri. As an essay published by the Church recently articulated,
Joseph’s study of the papyri may have led to a revelation about key events
and teachings in the life of Abraham, much as he had earlier received a

revelation about the life of Moses while studying the Bible. This view
assumes a broader definition of the words translator and translation.
According to this view, Joseph’s translation was not a literal rendering of
the papyri as a conventional translation would be. Rather, the physical artifacts provided an occasion for meditation, reflection, and revelation. They
catalyzed a process whereby God gave to Joseph Smith a revelation about
the life of Abraham, even if that revelation did not directly correlate to the
characters on the papyri.12
Those who adopt this theory urge Latter-day Saints to reconsider
the scope and mechanism of “translation” in Joseph Smith’s teachings
and scriptural productions.13 The strength of this theory is that it is consistent with some of the Prophet’s other scriptural productions. “One
advantage is that in Doctrine and Covenants section 7, Joseph Smith
translated an ancient papyrus that he never had in his possession; hence,
there is a precedent for Joseph Smith translating a papyrus that was not
in his possession, and so there is no reason to suppose that he had to
have the papyrus of the Book of Abraham in his possession either.”14 At
the same time, however, the main drawback to this theory is that Joseph
Smith himself believed that he possessed a physical record of Abraham
and claimed when he published the text that it was a “translation of some
ancient records . . . upon papyrus.”15
It could be argued that some of these (and other) theories might
be combined to form new paradigms. “As scholars continue to find,
research, and analyze the evidence that bears on this subject, future
studies will undoubtedly illuminate other theories that have not yet
been conceived.”16 Since The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
has not taken an official stance on how the translation of the Book of

Abraham was accomplished other than it was done by revelation, and

The Priesthood Ban and
the Book of Abraham
The Book of Abraham preserves an account of the founding of Egypt
(Abr. 1:23–27) and mentions the origins of a “curse in the land” (v. 24)
pertaining to the priesthood among the descendants of Ham. “The land
of Egypt,” the text says, was “first discovered by a woman, who was the
daughter of Ham, and the daughter of Egyptus” (v. 23). According to
this account, “when this woman discovered the land it was under water,
who afterward settled her sons in it; and thus, from Ham, sprang that
race which preserved the curse in the land” (v. 24). Before the text can
clarify what exactly this curse might be, it goes on to explain how the
effects of this curse were transmitted by the descendants of this Egyptus. “Now the first government of Egypt was established by Pharaoh, the
eldest son of Egyptus, the daughter of Ham, and it was after the manner
of the government of Ham, which was patriarchal” (v. 25), the account
continues. Although Pharaoh was “a righteous man” who “established
his kingdom and judged his people wisely and justly all his days” and
who sought “earnestly to imitate that order established by the fathers in
the first generations,” he was nevertheless “cursed” as “pertaining to the
Priesthood” (v. 26), since he was “of that lineage by which he could not
have the right of Priesthood, notwithstanding the Pharaohs would fain
claim it from Noah, through Ham” (v. 27). This claim, Abraham explains
in his account, is why his “father was led away by their idolatry” (v. 27).
This account expands on some of the details found in Genesis 9:18–
29, one of the most enigmatic passages of scripture. In the biblical story,
Ham, the son of Noah, saw his father “drunken and . . . uncovered within
his tent” (v. 21). When Ham informed his brothers Shem and Japheth of
their father’s condition, the latter two “took a garment, and laid it upon
both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness
of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their
The Priesthood Ban and the Book of Abraham 57
father’s nakedness” (v. 23). Upon awaking, Noah “knew what his younger
son had done” (v. 24) and so, in language similar to the Book of Abraham, “cursed” his grandson Canaan, the son of Ham, to be “a servant of
servants . . . unto his brethren” (v. 25). Precisely what Ham had done that
warranted Noah’s reprimand is unclear in the text. It is also unclear why
in the biblical account only Canaan was cursed among Ham’s children.1
The true significance and meaning of this account continues to be
debated among biblical exegetes, although a common reading of this
passage sees it as an etiology that “provide[s] a biblical justification for
the subsequent dispossession and oppression of the indigenous Canaanite population in Palestine by the people of Israel.”2 Even though the
Prophet Joseph Smith is known to have commented on this passage on
at least one occasion, nothing preserved in available records offers much
clarification.3
What is clear is that the curse of Ham in Genesis 9—along with
details about the descendants of Ham in the so-called Table of Nations in
Genesis 10:6–20—has historically been (mis)read to justify the enslavement of people of African descent.4 By Joseph Smith’s day, this racialized
reading of Genesis 9—which had circulated and evolved among Jews,
1. The Book of Abraham, as seen above, suggests that others among Ham’s descendants were also cursed, a detail missing from the biblical version.

the Canaanites).

Christians, and Muslims for several centuries—had become commonplace. At one point, the Prophet himself appeared to accept this reasoning for the enslavement of Blacks in the United States,5 although it is
not clear how much this reflected his personal belief as much as it was
a pragmatic attempt to distance Latter-day Saints from abolitionism,
which was still a radical political ideology in the early nineteenth century.6 In any case, Joseph’s views on slavery would ultimately develop
into a position of gradual emancipation. This stance was even made a
plank of his 1844 presidential platform.7
Whatever Joseph Smith believed about slavery or its justification in
light of Genesis 9, there is “no contemporary evidence” that he appealed
to the Book of Abraham for his racial ideas.8 This included his thinking
on the ordination of Black men to the priesthood. As one scholar put
it plainly, “even though Joseph Smith produced the Book of Abraham,
he never used it to justify a priesthood restriction.”9 As has been abundantly documented, at least two Black men were ordained to the priesthood in Joseph Smith’s lifetime.10 Current historical evidence seems to
indicate that it was only after the Prophet’s death that a ban on ordaining Black men to the priesthood and allowing Black men and women
to receive temple ordinances was imposed by Brigham Young.11 Despite

The Priesthood Ban and the Book of Abraham 59
this, however, “through three decades of discourses, Brigham Young
never attributed the policy of priesthood denial to Joseph Smith, nor did
he cite the Prophet’s translation of the book of Abraham in support of this
doctrine.”12 This is significant, since if the Book of Abraham was simply
the product of the racist environment and thinking of Joseph Smith and
his contemporaries, as some have alleged,13 then it is deeply curious why
neither he nor his immediate successor ever appeared to use it to justify their positions on slavery (either pro or con) or the priesthood and
temple ban. The “concern in the first chapter” of the Book of Abraham,
Joseph Smith’s premier biographer has observed, “was with civilizations
and lineage more than race. Pharaoh, Ham, and Egyptus figure in one
lineage and Abraham in another. The implications for modern race relations interested Joseph less than the configuration of family lines and the
descent of authority.”14
If neither Joseph Smith nor Brigham Young ever invoked the Book of
Abraham to address questions about slavery or the ordination of Blacks
to the priesthood, then whence did this practice arise? “Very simply,”
wrote scholar Lester Bush in a pioneering study, “the basic belief that
a lineage could be traced from Cain through the wife of Ham to the
modern [Black person] had long been accepted by the Church, independently of the Pearl of Great Price.”15 By 1847, Brigham Young and
other Church leaders began formulating and implementing their views
on why Blacks could not hold the priesthood.16 Apostle Parley P. Pratt,
for example, echoed the language of (but did not explicitly cite) the Book
of Abraham in an April 1847 discourse when he spoke of Blacks being
“cursed as regards [to] the priesthood.”17 His brother and fellow Apostle
Orson Pratt followed suit in 1853.18

Available evidence suggests that it was not until the 1880s with the
canonization of the Pearl of Great Price that Latter-day Saints began
explicitly using the Book of Abraham as the “scriptural linchpin of black
exclusion from the priesthood and the temple” under the misinterpretation that Black people were Ham’s cursed seed.19 Although earlier
expounders certainly may have had the Book of Abraham in mind with
some of their racial thinking,20 it would not be until some decades later
with influential writers such as John Taylor and B. H. Roberts that this
reading was made overt.21 By the turn of the century, this reading had
become the de facto “official” understanding.22 As Lester Bush explained,
When fully developed the Pearl of Great Price argument went as follows: Cain became black after murdering his brother Abel; among his
descendants were a people of Canaan who warred on their neighbors,
and were also identified as black. Ham, Noah’s son, married Egyptus,
a descendant of this Cain-Canaan lineage; Cain’s descendants had been
denied the priesthood, and thus Ham’s descendants were also denied
the priesthood; this was confirmed in the case of Pharaoh, a descendant
of Ham and Egyptus, and of the Canaanites, and who was denied the
priesthood; the modern [person of African descent] was of this CainHam lineage, and therefore was not eligible for the priesthood.23
Although the Book of Abraham would later be used to justify this
narrative, as scholars have paid closer attention to the text it has become
clearer that this reading is deeply problematic.24 In fact, despite what

20. Besides the Pratts, as cited above, Orson Hyde, in an 1845 speech, spoke of “the
negro or African race” being “the accursed lineage of Canaan.” But Hyde did not cite
the Book of Abraham in this speech, nor did he identify Blacks as being barred from
priesthood office. Furthermore, he couched his comments in the context of the supposed lack of valiance among Blacks in the pre-existence. Orson Hyde, Speech of Elder
Orson Hyde: Delivered before the High Priests Quorum in Nauvoo, April 27th, 1845 (Nauvoo, Ill.: John Taylor, 1845), 30. That Hyde derived his ideas on the behavior of Blacks in
the pre-existence from the Book of Abraham, which contains the most explicit details
in Latter-day Saint scripture on this topic (Abr. 3:22–28), seems likely but remains an
assumption.

some Latter-day Saints (and some critics of Joseph Smith) have assumed,
the Book of Abraham does not support the traditional (mis)reading of
Genesis 9 as condemning Blacks to perpetual slavery. Nor does it justify their being denied the priesthood. The most glaringly obvious problem is that nowhere in the text are the descendants of Ham said to have
dark skin. Neither, for that matter, are the descendants of Ham said to
be descendants of Cain; nor are they prophesied to be inheritors of this
curse after Abraham’s day.25
In short, “the Book of Abraham [simply] does not discuss race
and curses no one with slavery.”26 Although some Latter-day Saints
attempted to use the Book of Abraham as a proof text for their misconstrued understanding of the “curse of Ham” in Genesis 9 and as a rationale for Brigham Young’s priesthood and temple ban, “nowhere does
the text of the Book of Abraham support that interpretation.”27 It is true
that the Book of Abraham speaks of a “race which preserved the curse
in the land” descending from Ham and that this curse “pertain[ed] to
the Priesthood” (Abr. 1:24, 26). But “race” in this passage need not necessarily be read as describing those with specific skin color, and indeed,
the text never makes this correlation.
Furthermore, as both Hugh Nibley and W. Paul Reeve have observed,
the main issue at hand is not the skin color of Ham or his descendants,
which is left unmentioned in the Book of Abraham, but rather a question
of priesthood lineage and patriarchal versus matriarchal succession (Abr
1:25, 31). “Pharaoh’s claim to the priesthood,” wrote Nibley, “was invalid
because he insisted with great force that it was the patriarchal priesthood of Noah, received through the line of Ham (Abraham 1:25–27).

[Pharaoh’s] earthly rule was blessed (Abraham 1:26), but he could not, of
course, claim patriarchal lineage through his mother.”28 Abraham himself noted that, thanks to records at his disposal (v. 31), he could trace
that the priesthood had been passed from Noah through his ancestor Shem (compare Gen. 9:21–32; 11:10–32), and therefore he retained
a right to priesthood.29 In short, in the Book of Abraham “there is no
exclusive equation between Ham and Pharaoh, or between Ham and the
Egyptians, or between the Egyptians and the blacks, or between any of
the above and any particular curse. What was denied was recognition
of patriarchal right to the priesthood made by a claim of matriarchal
succession.”30
As for past attempts to use the Book of Abraham’s teachings about
the premortal existence to justify the priesthood and temple ban,31 suffice it to say the text provides no such rationale. While it is true that the
text speaks of the gradation of premortal “intelligences,” some of which
were “noble and great” and made “rulers” (Abr. 3:18–19, 21–23), it says
positively nothing about any of these intelligences being “neutral” in
the conflict with the one who “kept not his first estate” and drew many
others to follow after him (v. 28), much less that being neutral resulted in
them having been “cursed” with black skin in mortality and thus being
denied the priesthood or temple blessings in mortality.32 Attempts to

Young rejected this idea, affirming in April 1845 that “the Spirits of the Chil[dren] of Men
are pure & holy without transgress[io]n or any curse upon them—& the diff[erences] that
you see around you is on acc[oun]t. of the circumstances that surround them . . . some
have taught that bec[ause] persons are poor that it is on acc[oun]t. of transgress[io]n it
is false doctrine—from beginning to end.” “Council of Fifty, Minutes, March 1844–January 1846; Volume 2,” [208] n. 305. Young made a similar denial in December 1869. As
recorded in Wilford Woodruff ’s journal, on Christmas Day of that year the question was
The Priesthood Ban and the Book of Abraham 63
justify the priesthood and temple ban with the Book of Abraham’s teachings on premortality are, accordingly, fallacious and unfounded.
In any case, leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
today have officially disavowed racialized readings of these passages
from Genesis and the Book of Abraham: “Today, the Church disavows
the theories advanced in the past that black skin is a sign of divine disfavor or curse, or that it reflects unrighteous actions in a premortal life;
that mixed-race marriages are a sin; or that blacks or people of any other
race or ethnicity are inferior in any way to anyone else. Church leaders today unequivocally condemn all racism, past and present, in any
form.”33 President Russell M. Nelson reaffirmed this in the October 2020
general conference. “I assure you that your standing before God is not
determined by the color of your skin,” he taught. “Favor or disfavor with
God is dependent upon your devotion to God and His commandments
and not the color of your skin.”34
As W. Paul Reeve has bluntly (and correctly) put it, “there is no need
to defend past statements on race when this generation of leaders has
disavowed them.”35 There is likewise no need to defend faulty interpretation of scripture that does a disservice to the text and hinders our understanding. The Book of Abraham’s teachings about race, lineage, and
priesthood are more complex than was previously recognized by readers
primed by specific cultural conditions to read the text in a certain way.
Nothing should stop us from probing this text with the best available
current exegetical tools and methodologies.
posed in the School of the Prophets whether “the Spirits of Negroes were Nutral [neutral]
in Heaven,” a teaching some were attributing to Joseph Smith. “President Young said
No they were not there was No Nutral spirits in Heaven at the time of the Rebelion all
took sides. He said if any one said that He Herd the Prophet Joseph Saiy that the spirits
of the Blacks were Nutral in Heaven He would not Believe them for He herd Joseph
say to the contrary all spirits are pure that come from the presence of God” (compare
Doctrine and Covenants 93:38). Brigham would then go on to give his view that Blacks
were the offspring of Cain and therefore cursed, but that all the children of Adam would
have an opportunity for receiving redemption and salvation except for the Sons of Perdition. “Journal (October 22, 1865–December 31, 1872,” December 25, 1869, 221–22, Wilford

Ur of the Chaldees
The opening verse of the Book of Abraham places the beginning of the
patriarch’s story “in the land of the Chaldeans” (Abr. 1:1). Several references to the city of Ur and “Ur of the Chaldees” are also present in the
text (Abr. 1:20; 2:1, 4, 15; 3:1). This location is said to be the “residence of
[Abraham’s] fathers” and Abraham’s own residence and “country” (Abr.
1:1; 2:3).
The Book of Abraham gives some specific details about Ur and this
“land of the Chaldeans” that are not found in the Genesis account (Gen.
11:26–32; 12:1–5). This includes an apparent degree of Egyptian cultural
and religious influence in the area (Abr. 1:6, 8–9, 11, 13) and being in or
near the vicinity of “the plain of Olishem” (Abr. 1:10).
Where exactly is Abraham’s “Ur of the Chaldees”? For centuries, the
traditional location for Muslims, Jews, and Christians was the city of
Urfa (modern Sanliurfa in southern Turkey). In the 1920s, however, the
excavations of Sir Leonard Woolley at Tell el-Muqayyar in southern Iraq
identified an ancient Sumerian city called Urim or Uru.1 Woolley argued
that this site was the location of Abraham’s Ur, not the traditional site
in Turkey. Woolley’s argument has since gained widespread acceptance
among biblical scholars.
While Woolley’s identification of Urim with the biblical Ur has
remained popular, other scholars have challenged it. Chief among them

Museum, 1927–62); Leonard Woolley, Ur of the Chaldees (London: E. Benn., 1929);

has been Cyrus Gordon, a member of Woolley’s excavation team2 who disputed Woolley’s identification on linguistic and archaeological grounds.3
He and a vocal minority of scholars have argued for candidates in northern Syria and Turkey as being Abraham’s Ur and have urged scholars to
look there for correlations with the topography of the Abraham stories in
Genesis.4
An additional complication besides locating Abraham’s Ur is identifying the ancient “Chaldeans” or “Chaldees” mentioned in both the
Book of Abraham and the book of Genesis. Our best current evidence
suggests they were a nomadic Semitic tribe from modern Syria that
emigrated into Mesopotamia and established a dynasty that eventually came to power as the Babylonian Empire.5 The infamous biblical
king Nebuchadnezzar was a descendant of these Chaldeans, and by his
time the name Chaldean had become synonymous with Babylonian.6
2. Cyrus H. Gordon, A Scholar’s Odyssey (Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature,
2000), 35–36. Gordon was skeptical of Woolley’s efforts to “prove” the Bible was true for
“well-heeled and God-fearing widows,” feeling that his efforts to link Abraham’s Ur with
Tell el-Muqayyar compromised his otherwise “masterful” archaeological abilities.

Babylonian Period,” in Arameans, Chaldeans, and Arabs in Babylonia and Palestine in the
First Millennium B.C., ed. A. Berlejung and M. P. Streck (Wiesbaden, Ger.: Harrassowitz,
2013), 33, 51, who points out that “relying solely on cuneiform sources from Babylonia,
which are relatively abundant, we find no evidence that Nebuchadnezzar considered
himself the ruler of Chaldeans and Arameans.” Instead, the Neo-Babylonian dynasty
Ur of the Chaldees 69
Unfortunately, we have little inscriptional or archaeological evidence
for the identity of the Chaldeans before they entered Mesopotamia long
after Abraham’s lifetime. We therefore still have large gaps in the archaeological record that do not permit us to say much about the Chaldeans
during Abraham’s day.
Latter-day Saint scholars who have approached this question have
pointed out that a northern Syrian-Turkish location for Ur appears more
favorable for the Book of Abraham than a southern Mesopotamian location.7 For one thing, as mentioned, the Book of Abraham depicts some
kind of Egyptian cultural influence or presence in and around Abraham’s
homeland of Ur. Abraham’s kinsfolk included “the god of Pharaoh” in
their ritual worship (along with a priest to lead them in that worship who
served both a god named Elkenah and the Pharaoh) and practiced ritual
human sacrifice “after the manner of the Egyptians” (Abr. 1:6–13). There
is presently no evidence for Egyptian influence in southern Mesopotamia
during the lifetime of Abraham (ca. 2000–1800 BC), but there is evidence
for Egyptian influence in northern Syria at this time.8 This does not necessarily preclude a southern location for Abraham’s Ur, since absence of
appears to have “adopted an archaizing political vocabulary which harked back to the
time of the First Dynasty of Babylon and even to the Old Akkadian period. The perennial and unchanging nature of Babylonian civilization and its Sumero-Akkadian heritage was emphasized, and the reality of a society fragmented along ethnic, tribal, and
linguistic lines, as well as by several other factors of social and institutional nature seems
to be denied.”

evidence is not evidence of absence, but a northern Ur would appear,
based on current evidence, to converge better with what is depicted in the
Book of Abraham.
Additionally, the proximity of Abraham’s Ur to “the plain of Olishem”
is an important geographical detail that works best in a northern location as opposed to a southern one. The Book of Abraham’s Olishem has
been plausibly identified with the ancient city of Ulisum or Ulishum
located somewhere in southern Turkey (although the precise location
remains debated).9
Taken together, the evidence from the Book of Abraham text and
external archaeological and inscriptional sources can reasonably point
us in the direction of modern northern Syria and southern Turkey as
the ancient homeland of Abraham. While there are many questions that
scholars still grapple with, enough evidence has surfaced over the years
to paint an overall plausible picture of the historical and geographical
world described in the Book of Abraham.

Abraham and Idrimi
The Book of Abraham narrates the life of the biblical patriarch in a
first-person autobiographical voice. The book begins: “In the land
of the Chaldeans, at the residence of my fathers, I, Abraham, saw that it
was needful for me to obtain another place of residence” (Abr. 1:1). This
first-person voice continues throughout the text as if Abraham himself
was writing.
When the Book of Abraham was published in 1842, with the exception of portions of the Bible, no other purported autobiographical texts
from the ancient Near East were known. The Book of Abraham was
unique in that respect. In the last nearly two hundred years, archaeology has uncovered more texts that we can compare with the Book of
Abraham. One such ancient text discovered in 1939 contains strikingly
similar features to those of the Book of Abraham. It too is an “autobiography” in that it narrates a story in the first person. It speaks of a ruler
named Idrimi who lived in ancient Syria not long after the likely time of
Abraham (ca. 2000–1800 BC).1 “Idrimi’s autobiography compares well
with Abraham’s autobiography in both subject and form, even though
Idrimi’s autobiography dates about two hundred years later.”2
Although scholars frequently call Idrimi’s inscription an “autobiography,”3 this term might be somewhat misleading. One scholar

surveying this subject has written that “there is no autobiography as such in the ancient world,
if we describe ‘autobiography’
as the retrospective interpretation of the author’s own life—a
contemplative self-scrutiny of
the past. . . . There are, however,
ancient texts that seem autobiographical, in which first-person
narrators recount what they represent as parts of their own lives.”4
This is further complicated by the
fact that “we do not know if such
ancient autobiographical texts
were written by the individuals
themselves, dictated to scribes,
or ghostwritten by scribes.”5
On the other hand, Egyptologists reviewing Egyptian (auto)biographical tomb inscriptions from
Abraham’s day tend to think that

position of self-awareness and
reflection, then ancient Egyptian autobiographical inscriptions were true autobiographies,” even if “their self-awareness was more

elementary and naive than the modern varieties.”6 As summarized in
another recent scholarly publication on this topic,
(Auto-)biography is a genre of ancient Egyptian written discourse that
was central to high culture from its earliest periods. Inscribed in hieroglyphs, the formal, display-oriented, and sacralizing variety of the Egyptian script, these texts belonged to the nonroyal elites. They present,
with rare exceptions in the first person, aspects of individual lives and
experience, sometimes as narratives of key events, sometimes as characterizations of personal qualities, often bringing about a configuration
of the speaker with distinguished beings or realities such as the king,
the gods, or order (Maat). Thousands of such texts are known from the
mid-third millennium BCE to early Roman times, undergoing significant changes over time.7
As with Northwest Semitic and Mesopotamian (auto)biographical
texts,8 however, we must appreciate that these texts may not have been
entirely true “(auto)biographies” in the sense we often mean today.
The texts that we often conventionally term as biographies (or autobiographies) frustrate expectations associated with Western definitions
of the similarly termed types of discourse, which may be misleading
more than anything else in studying the Egyptian material. Egyptian
biographical texts underwent significant changes in format, materiality,

Ancient Egyptian Biographies: Contexts, Forms, Functions, ed. Julie Stauder-Prochet, Elizabeth Frood, and Andréas Stauder (Atlanta: Lockwood Press, 2020), 1. A cursory glance
at this volume, which contains a collection of studies on the subjects of (auto)biography
from ancient Egypt and cognate cultures, reveals a wealth of material from the ancient
world that may prove highly relevant and interesting to the Book of Abraham. Literary
analyses of the Book of Abraham, including comparative analyses with other ancient
(auto)biographical texts, are sadly wanting. Future study on this point seems expeditious
and a worthwhile avenue of continued research.
8. On the latter, consult Christopher Woods, “Self-Representation in Mesopotamia:
The Literary Evidence,” in Ancient Egyptian Biographies, 29–46, who explains that “the
closest Mesopotamian counterpart to the Egyptian tomb inscriptions, at least in terms
of outlining a career and highlighting scenes from a life, are the royal inscriptions, which
celebrate a king’s accomplishments or chronicle military campaigns, and are often cast
in the first person. Certainly, there is autobiographical content of a personal kind to be
gleaned from this large corpus” (quote at 29; for his discussion of the Idrimi text as “the
first of our historically grounded pseudo-autobiographies,” see pages 32–35).

contexts, configurations of language, and functions over the three thousand years of their history. Despite such variety, they are intuitively recognized as a specific type of Egyptian written discourse, differentiated
from other types (e.g., literary or funerary) by particular constraints of
decorum and specific functions.9
In any case, while it is “unlikely that Idrimi carved the words on his
statue, . . . he may have been directly responsible for the content of the
text.”10 From an ancient point of view, it would not have really mattered
if an author of a text used a scribe to do the physical writing or even
influence the composition. If he was following known ancient literary
conventions, then it is possible—and indeed likely—that Abraham similarly employed a scribe to help him compose his text.11
Another problem is that scholars are not always sure how much
ancient Near Eastern “autobiographical” texts are fictional as opposed to
historical. While it is certainly possible that these texts recounted realworld events or captured authentic experiences in the life being narrated,
it is also likely that they exaggerated or even fabricated elements of the
story to suit the literary and ideological preferences of their subjects.12
“Ancient authors writing in the first person understandably sought to
justify and promote themselves or, in the case of scribal authors, their
patrons. When that is all they do, their literary products have little more
than historical interest.”13
Regardless of how much historicity we assign to it, the parallels
between Idrimi’s “autobiography” and Abraham’s record are unmistakable and include both reporting their journeys through Canaan, both
emphasizing that their travel to their new residence was the result of
divine inspiration, both referring back to promises made to their ancestors for whom they have records, both describing that they worshipped
the way that their fathers did, and both dealing in covenants.14 Idrimi
and Abraham also parallel each other in another important way. “Many

ancient near eastern royal inscriptions employ first-person discourse;
but virtually no other text quotes the speaker’s inner thoughts and personalizes the significance of his accomplishments as does [Idrimi’s]
narrative.”15 Similar to Idrimi’s account, the Book of Abraham quotes the
patriarch’s inner thoughts and personalizes the narrative (for example,
Abr. 2:12–13). The two texts also open in very similar manners:
Book of Abraham (1:1) “Autobiography” of Idrimi
“In the land of the Chaldeans, at the
residence of my fathers, I, Abraham,
saw that it was needful for me to
obtain another place of residence.”
“In Aleppo, my ancestral home . . .
I, Idrimi, the son of Ilim-ilimma . . .
took my horse, chariot, and groom and
went away.”16
The parallels between these two texts, as well as other considerations,
indicate that “the Book of Abraham belongs to the same specific literary
tradition as Idrimi’s autobiography.” This, naturally, raises the question,
“How did Joseph Smith manage to publish in the Book of Abraham a
story that closely matched a Middle-Bronze-Age Syrian autobiography
that would not be discovered for nearly a hundred years?”17 The most
plausible explanation is that the Book of Abraham belongs to that time
period, genre of literature, and part of the world.

Human Sacrifice
The Book of Abraham begins with an account of the biblical patriarch
Abraham almost being sacrificed to the “dumb idols” and “strange
gods” of his kinsfolk (Abr. 1:7–8). The form of sacrifice practiced by
Abraham’s kinsfolk in Ur of the Chaldees (vv. 8, 13) was said to be “after
the manner of the Egyptians” (vv. 9, 11), and indeed a “priest of Pharaoh”
was involved in this procedure (vv. 7–8, 10). This suggests that Abraham’s kinsfolk had adopted Egyptian practices and incorporated these
elements into their local (Chaldean) rituals.
This raises the question of whether the ancient Egyptians ever practiced what is commonly called “human sacrifice.”1 Scholars disagree
on what precise terminology to use when describing this phenomenon.
Egyptologists typically use phrases such as “sacred violence,” “ritual
slaying,” “sanctioned killing,” “capital punishment,” “ritual homicide,”
and the like to avoid the pejorative connotations that arise with the
term “human sacrifice.”2 Whatever it is called, however, the practice
1. Past studies have looked at the practice of “human sacrifice” among Mesopotamian and Levantine peoples and the implications for the Book of Abraham. See William
James Adams Jr., “Human Sacrifice and the Book of Abraham,” BYU Studies 9, no. 4
(1969): 473–80; and Kevin Barney, “On Elkenah as Canaanite El,” Journal of the Book of

documented among the ancient Egyptians ultimately involved putting
humans to death for transgressing religious or political boundaries and
norms, sometimes done in a ritualistic or ceremonial manner. There is,
in the words of one Egyptologist, “indisputable evidence for the practice
of human sacrifice in classical ancient Egypt.”3
Some of the evidence for this practice dates to the likely time of
Abraham (ca. 2000–1800 BC), and “the story presented in the Book
of Abraham matches remarkably well with the picture of ritual slaying” in Egypt during the same period.4 For example, a stone inscription
from the eighteenth century BC records “the establishment of penalties
for intruders [of sacred space]: anyone found within the limits, except
a priest on duty, is to be burnt.”5 This indicates a cultural setting “in
which slaying someone for desecration of sacred space was an accepted
practice.”6 A royal inscription from two centuries earlier depicts the
Egyptian king decreeing death upon “children of the enemy” for desecrating a temple. This apparently included punishment by flaying,
impalement, beheading, and burning. “When the sacred house of a god
had been desecrated, the Egyptian king responded by sacrificing those
responsible.”7
There is also direct archaeological evidence for “human sacrifice” or
ritual slaying at an Egyptian fortress at the site of Mirgissa in northern
(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2020), 342–59, esp. 350–52; and Jacobus van
Dijk, “Ritual Homicide in Ancient Egypt,” in The Value of a Human Life: Ritual Killing
and Human Sacrifice in Antiquity, ed. Karel C. Innemée (Leiden, Neth.: Rijksmuseum
van Oudheden, 2022), 41–52. It should be remembered that the Book of Abraham itself
never calls the practice described in its opening chapter “human sacrifice,” instead referring to it as the “sacrifice of the heathen” (Abr. 1:7), an “offering,” or a “thank-offering”
(vv. 8–10). Quibbling over what Egyptologists today prefer to call the practice is largely a
red herring. What matters is whether what is described in the text of the Book of Abraham converges with the external evidence.

Sudan. During the time of Abraham, this site was part of the Egyptian
empire and was under Egyptian control. Discovered at the site was
“a deposit . . . containing various ritual objects such as melted wax figurines, a flint knife, and the decapitated body of a foreigner slain during
rites designed to ward off enemies. Almost universally, this discovery
has been accepted as a case of human sacrifice.”8
This view is supported by execration texts, or magical spells used
to ward off evil and curse enemies by ritually destroying a wax or clay
human effigy (comparable to a voodoo doll).9 It would appear from
the evidence uncovered at Mirgissa that on some occasions these rituals were performed on actual human victims, including foreigners who
were seen as a threat to Egyptian political and social order.10
From this evidence, we can conclude that Egyptian “human sacrifice”
during Abraham’s lifetime was more or less “ritual” in nature, that it was
sometimes undertaken “for cultic offenses” or offenses against Egypt’s
gods, that “the pharaoh [was sometimes] involved and the sacrifice [was
sometimes] under his orders,” that sometimes these sacrifices were initiated “for rebellion against the pharaoh,” and that “the sacrifice could
take place both in Egypt proper and outside the boundaries in areas
under Egyptian influence.”11 While caution is still necessary because of
gaps in the available data, enough evidence is available to indicate that
“institutionally sanctioned ritual violence [in ancient Egypt] centered
[on] two main ideas: interference with cult, and rebellion.”12 This converges remarkably well with the Book of Abraham, offering a plausible
historical context for Abraham’s near-sacrifice.

The Idolatrous God Elkenah
The Book of Abraham tells how Abraham’s kinsfolk worshipped false
gods. One of these was “the god of Elkenah” (Abr. 1:6). When Abraham preached against the worship of this god, he said that his kinsfolk
“hearkened not unto [his] voice, but endeavored to take away [his] life
by the hand of the priest of Elkenah” (v. 7). Not only did the priest try to
take Abraham’s life, but “this priest had offered upon this altar three virgins at one time, . . . because of their virtue; they would not bow down
to worship gods of wood or of stone, therefore they were killed upon
this altar” (v. 11). Fortunately, the angel of the Lord delivered Abraham out of the priest’s hands before he could be sacrificed (vv. 15–20;
Facsimile 1).
What do we know about the ancient god Elkenah? No deity of that
name is mentioned in the King James Bible,1 but in the last century archaeologists have unearthed evidence of his worship. Elkenah is very likely
the shortened form of the name of the Canaanite god ʾel-qoneh-ha-ʾareṣ,
meaning “God who created the earth” (or “God, creator of the earth”).2
1. The name Elkanah appears in the KJV Bible as a masculine personal name for
humans. It is, for example, the name of the prophet Samuel’s father (1 Sam. 1:1, 4, 8, 19,
21, 23). A form of the name appears in the Hebrew Bible as a divine epithet (for example,
Gen. 14:19, 22), but in the KJV it is translated (“God, possessor of heaven and earth”) as
opposed to transliterated as a proper name/epithet (ʾēl ʿelyôn qōnēh šāmayîm wā-ʾāreṣ).
The personal name Elkanah in the Bible is derived from this divine name/epithet. Compare N. Avigad, “Excavations in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem, 1971
(Third Preliminary Report),” Israel Exploration Journal 22, no. 4 (1972): 195–96.

The Idolatrous God Elkenah 81
Among the ancient Hittites living in Asia Minor he was known as
Elkunirsha.3
Originally a Canaanite deity, his worship spread to the Hittite capital
of Hattusha in northern Turkey, to Karatepe near the border of modern
Turkey and Syria, to Palmyra in inland Syria, to Jerusalem, and to Leptis Magna in Libya. All told, Elkunirsha was worshipped for more than
1,500 years—from the time of Abraham to the time of Christ.4
We know something about Elkunirsha (Elkenah) from a Canaanite
myth that was preserved by the Hittites.5 Unfortunately, the clay tablets
containing this myth are broken, so we do not have all the story. One
scholar summarized the story as follows: “Ašertu, the wife of Elkunirša,
attempts to seduce Ba’al [the storm god]. The Storm-god reveals everything to her husband and insults her on his inspiration. Thirsting for
revenge, Ašertu regains the favor of her husband who then lets her do
whatever she likes with Ba’al. The goddess Anat now comes on the scene.
Having overheard the conversation between Elkunirša and Ašertu, she
warns Ba’al.”6

Then the text unfortunately breaks off. What the evidence appears
to indicate, however, is that, along with the other deities in the text,7 the
god Elkenah mentioned in the Book of Abraham has very likely been
identified in the ancient world.

Sobek, the God of Pharaoh
The opening chapter of the Book of Abraham identifies “the god of
Pharaoh” as being one of the idolatrous gods worshipped by Abraham’s kinsfolk (Abr. 1:6, 9, 13, 17). In figure 9 of Facsimile 1 of the Book
of Abraham, this god is depicted as a crocodile. Is there any evidence for
who this god might have been and whether he was worshipped in Abraham’s lifetime (ca. 2000–1800 BC)?
A strong case can be made for identifying the “god of Pharaoh” in
the Book of Abraham as the Egyptian deity Sobek.1 This god was worshipped even before Abraham’s day and was commonly depicted as either
a crocodile-headed man or a crocodile wearing a crown.2 Anciently, “he
was regarded as a powerful deity with several important associations,”
among them “procreative and vegetative fertility” and, importantly for
the Book of Abraham, “the Egyptian king . . . as a symbol of pharaonic
potency and might.”3
The worship of Sobek was popular in Egypt in Abraham’s day.
Many names from this period contain the name Sobek as a theophoric

element,4 including the names of the last ruler of the Twelfth Dynasty
(ca. 1991–1782 BC) and of no less than seven different rulers of the Thirteenth Dynasty (ca. 1800–1650 BC), who may likely have been coterminous with Abraham and the other patriarchs from Genesis.5 “[Sobek’s]
sanctuaries were numerous and widespread” throughout Egypt during this time.6 Iconography of the god Sobek even made its way into
northern Syria. At the site of Ebla, an important Syrian city throughout the third and second millennia BC, artifacts bearing the images
of different Egyptian gods, including Sobek, have been identified by
archaeologists.7
The ancient Egyptian king Amenemhet III, who may have been a
contemporary of Abraham, venerated Sobek, bringing the god “to specific prominence” during his reign.8 “With Amenemhat III, Sobek of
Shedet became the best example of the success of the crocodile-gods in

piece of palatial furniture further highlights the association of Egyptian art with Eblaite
elitism and power.”

From this evidence unknown in Joseph Smith’s day,12 we can say the
following about “the god of Pharaoh” in the Book of Abraham and Facsimile 1. First, the god in question is arguably the crocodile deity Sobek.
Second, among other things, Sobek was closely associated with the Pharaoh of Egypt.13 Third, Sobek was especially venerated by King Amenemhet III, a possible contemporary of Abraham. Fourth, and finally,
specimens of Sobek iconography have been recovered from the likely
region of Abraham’s homeland during the right period for Abraham’s
lifetime (the Middle Bronze Age).
control over the whole world, from the waters to the sky, but he was essentially a god
who had become Horus and, as such, connected with royal doctrines. The image of the
crocodile is . . . the shape that Horus himself adopts when entering the Fayyum. Moreover, the temple of Sobek became a centre for the recognition of the royal power. The
syncretism between the two deities and the new group of epithets had a specific function.
They not only increased the importance of the local—and provincial—crocodile-god,
but they also served the king, who could receive the divine essence of kingship only from
a god who was able to be strongly royal.”
12. One source contemporary to Joseph Smith did report that “the crocodile or hippopotamus” was “the emblem of Pharaoh and the Egyptians” and “was one of their principal divinities.” This source also reported that “Pharaoh . . . signifies a crocodile.” Adam
Clarke, The Holy Bible, Containing the Old and New Testaments, 6 vols. (London: Thomas
Tegg and Son, 1836), 1:1901, 281. (This Bible edition with Clarke’s notes was based on an
eight-volume commentary series Clarke published between 1810–1826.) By contrast, the
Book of Abraham says nothing about hippopotami and indicates that “Pharaoh signifies
king by royal blood” (Abr. 1:20), not “crocodile.” Furthermore, none of the archaeological or inscriptional evidence confirming Sobek’s presence in northern Syria or his association with Egyptian kingship was available in Joseph Smith’s lifetime.

emphasis in original: “It was Amenemhat III who brought the role of ‘Sobek of ShedetHorus residing in Shedet’ to the highest significance. Sobek-Horus of Shedet became
associated with epithets like ‘Lord of the wrrt (White) Crown,’ ‘he who resides in the
great palace’ and ‘lord of the great palace.’ All of these epithets were related to the king
rather than associated with any god. Even the name of Horus in this merged form was
enclosed in a serekh like a king’s name. The king has always been identified as Horus on
earth. With the new divine form of Sobek-Horus, the king as Horus merged with Sobek
and incorporated himself as one with the god Sobek. Sobek’s association with divine
kingship is illustrated in the Amenemhat III’s ‘Baptism of the Pharaoh’ scene at his
Madinet Madi Temple in Fayum. This scene, the earliest of its kind, depicts Sobek and
Anubis anointing Amenemhat III with ankh signs of life. The anointment marks the
king’s initiation into eternal kingship and was usually related to the state god’s divine
procreation of the king.”
Sobek, the God of Pharaoh 87
All of this reinforces the argument that “the [B]ook of Abraham
accurately describes an aspect of the ancient world about which Joseph
Smith could have known little or nothing.”14

The Plain of Olishem
The opening chapter of the Book of Abraham mentions a location
called “the plain of Olishem” (Abr. 1:10). It isn’t clear from the text
whether the plain itself was Olishem, or whether Olishem was some
city or region in the area to which the plain was adjacent, or whether
the plain takes its name from a major city on the plain. In any case, this
“plain of Olishem” was near Abraham’s homeland of Ur of the Chaldees,
according to the text.
In 1985, a Latter-day Saint archaeologist named John M. Lundquist
published a pioneering article situating the Book of Abraham in an
ancient geographical and cultural environment in northern Mesopotamia.1 Among the points raised by Lundquist was the possible identification of the Book of Abraham’s Olishem with the ancient place name
Ulisum (or Ulishum).2 Lundquist pointed to inscriptional evidence

from the ancient city of Ur in southern Mesopotamia dating to the
time of the Akkadian king Naram-Sin (who reigned ca. 2254–2218 BC),
which spoke of this Ulisum in what is today northern Syria or southern
Turkey.3 The relevant portion of the inscription reads:
Whereas, for all time since the formation of humankind there has never
been a king who overthrew Armanum and Ebla, by the weapon(?) of
Nergal did Naram-Sin, the mighty, open the only path and he gave him
Aranum and Ebla. He bestowed upon him Amanus, the Cedar Mountain and the Upper Sea, and, by the weapon of Dagan, exalter of his
kingship, did Naram-Sin, the mighty, defeat Armanum and Ebla. Then,
from the very mouth of the Eurphrates, he smote the river(-bank) as
far as Ulisum [u-li-si-imki], as well as the people whom Dagan had for
the first time bestowed upon him, and they bear for him the burden
of Ilaba his god. The Amanus too, mount of cedars, he conquered
completely.4
In 2020, additional inscriptional evidence from another site in modern Iraq (Tulul al-Baqarat) was published that further documented
Naram-Sin’s conquest of Armanum and Ebla.5 As with the inscription
from Ur, this source also identifies a place called Ulisum: “[Indeed,]
with the weapon of Dagan, the one who magnifies his kingship, NaramSin the mighty conquered Armanum and Ebla. Moreover, from the edge
of the Euphrates as far as Ulisum, [he smote the peoples whom Dagan
had newly bestowed upon him].”6 Scholars have debated the location
of this ancient Ulisum, and multiple sites have been proposed over the

years, with no clear consensus having been reached other than that it lies
somewhere west of the Euphrates River in southern Turkey.7
Subsequent studies since Lundquist’s initial proposal have strengthened his enticing identification of Olishem in the Book of Abraham as
ancient Ulisum.8 In fact, one non–Latter-day Saint archaeologist working in the area has favorably suggested a possible (though inconclusive)
connection between Olishem in the Book of Abraham and Ulisum
from Naram-Sin’s inscription.9 In 2013, excavators at the Turkish site of
Oylum Höyük near the Syrian border announced that it was the ancient
Ulisum mentioned in Naram-Sin’s inscription and identified it as “the
city of Abraham.” Because more archaeological investigation needs to
be undertaken at the site, the confirmatory significance of this evidence
for the Book of Abraham is “promising but not [yet] proven.”10 There are
still gaps in the archaeological and inscriptional record that preclude a
definitive identification of the Book of Abraham’s Olishem with any particular archaeological site at this time.11 Nevertheless, the following can
be said with a fair amount of certainty:
There is definitely an ancient site with the name Ulisum or Ulishum.
There is no agreement as to the precise location of Ulisum, but it
can most likely be identified in a specific general region (west of the
Euphrates in southern Turkey). Many scholars are currently interested
in exploring where precisely Ulisum may be in this region.
Olishem is a name from the Book of Abraham, which matches the
phonetics and time period of the known site of Ulis[h]um.

So, whereas Engin, “Oylum Höyük İçin Bir Lokalizasyon Önerisi,” 129–49, argues that
the site was ancient Ulisum, another scholar has argued that it was called Ḫaššu(wa)
based on his reading of some inscriptional evidence discovered at the site. Ahmet Ünal,
“A Hittite Treaty Tablet from Oylum Höyük in Southeastern Turkey and the Location of
Ḫaššu(wa),” Anatolian Studies 65 (2015): 19–34. In any case, “strong support from written sources and archaeological material is lacking,” so “the question [of the identity of
Oylum Höyük] remains to be answered unequivocally only if and when further evidence turns up, which can only be supplied by texts.” Ünal, “Hittite Treaty Tablet from
Oylum Höyük,” 32.
The Plain of Olishem 91
A likely region of the ancient Ulisum matches well with some geographic interpretations of the Book of Abraham.12
Textual and archaeological studies about Ulisum can inform our
understanding of the Book of Abraham, and studying the Book of
Abraham can in turn inform these textual and archaeological studies
because the Book of Abraham provides geographical information about
Olishem not available in any other extant ancient source.13 Future discoveries may shed further light on this topic, but for now it can be said
that Ulisum is plausible and promising (though not yet definitive) evidence for the Book of Abraham’s Olishem.14

Potiphar’s Hill
Besides Ur of the Chaldees and the plain of Olishem, one of the geographical features of the Book of Abraham is a location called Potiphar’s Hill, which is said to be “at the head of the plain of Olishem” in the
land of Chaldea (Abr. 1:10). It was at this hill that “the priest of Pharaoh”—
who was also in the service of a solar deity named Shagreel—made offerings on an altar (vv. 9–10). Other sacrifices were made at this site, and it
also appears to have been the site of local idol worship (vv. 11–12).
Hugh Nibley was one of the first to argue that Potiphar’s Hill functioned as what scholars today call a cult center, meaning a location of
special religious significance that was dedicated to the worship of a particular deity or group of deities.1 Cult centers dotted the landscape of the
ancient Near East, including Mesopotamia, Anatolia, the Levant, and

Nibley, Richards Durham conducted an unpublished study of Potiphar’s Hill and the five
gods associated with this location (Elkenah, Libnah, Mahmackrah, Pharaoh, and Shagreel),
arguing that this named site and attending gods in the Book of Abraham functioned as a
deity complex. Whatever the deficiencies in Durham’s proposed etymologies for the names
of the deities in the text, he was perceptive to notice how Potiphar’s Hill functions as a cult
center or deity complex. See Richards Durham, “‘Potiphar’s Hill’ and the ‘Canopic’ Complex of the Gods,” unpublished manuscript, 1960, L. Tom Perry Special Collections, Harold B. Lee Library, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah.
Potiphar’s Hill 93
Egypt. “The cult centers of the ancient world were the prime location
and focus of ritual activity. Temples and shrines were not constructed in
isolation, but existed as part of what may be termed a ritual landscape,
where ritualized movement within individual buildings, temple complexes, and the city as a whole shaped their function and meaning.”2 At
each site was often a shrine or temple dedicated to the chief deity being
worshipped, although multiple deities (typically the chief deity and his or
her divine consort) were sometimes worshipped at the same cult center.3
In ancient Syria and Anatolia, pilgrimages were frequently made to cult
sites in the countryside,4 and “at each cult center, the gods were [given]
offerings of food and drink. . . . The deities also received animal sacrifices,
particularly at the great festivals.”5 Similar to what is depicted in the Book
of Abraham, “even human sacrifice, though rare, was not unknown.”6
The worshippers at Potiphar’s Hill were engaged in a form of
Egyptian-Canaanite syncretic religious practice. The Egyptian element
in the narrative is obvious from the god (and priest) of Pharaoh being
present in the scene. It can also be seen in the name Potiphar. Famously

city. Billie Jean Collins, “Anatolia,” in Spaeth, Cambridge Companion to Ancient Mediterranean Religions, 102.

the name of the Egyptian officer who bought Joseph as a slave (Gen.
39:1), Potiphar has long been recognized as deriving from the Egyptian
pA-di-pA-Ra or pA-di-Pra (“the one whom [the god] Re has given”).7
Although the name Potiphar itself is only currently attested after Abraham’s day, the grammatical formula used in the name (pA-di-[X]; “the
one whom [such-and-such god] has given”) appears to be based on an
earlier formula that is found plentifully in Egyptian names from Abraham’s day.8 The Re element in the name Potiphar links the name (and
thereby the cult site in the Book of Abraham) with solar worship, inasmuch as Re was the chief solar deity of ancient Egypt.9 This explains why
the idolatrous priest in the Book of Abraham is depicted in the text as
making an offering to the god of Shagreel, which is identified as a sun
deity (Abr. 1:9). The veneration of this deity in Egypt predates Abraham’s

could have been as old as Abraham, even if it is not yet attested.11
What’s more, “very good knowledge . . . of the Egyptian iconographic
patrimony” is attested in northern Syria at sites such as Ebla, where
“Egyptianiz[ed]” ivories bearing the iconography of multiple Egyptian
deities have been recovered.12 Some of these recovered ivories include
samples featuring “the crocodile god Sobek, gods having the head of the
falcon Horus, and a goddess bearing the horns and the sun disc of Hathor.
Such figures appear frequently in the contemporary Syrian glyptic of
the classical Old Syrian style, where they are shown with divine figures
of the Syrian pantheon and kings and officials of the northern Syrian
kingdoms.”13 According to one scholar, “Egyptian and Egyptianising
scenes and figures constitute c. 14 per cent of the total iconographical
repertoire of published Syrian seals.”14 Solar deities such as Re-Horakhty

for an overview of the history and significance of Heliopolis (biblical On and Egyptian Iunu), the “city of the sun” that was the location of a significant cult dedicated to
Re(-Atum) beginning as early as the Old Kingdom (potentially as early as the twentyseventh century BC). “By the time of the Old Kingdom, the city was established as a
center of astronomy, as reflected in the title of its high priest, ‘Chief of Observers.’ The
city also had a reputation for learning and theological speculation, which it retained into
Greco-Roman times; much of that was centered on the role of the sun in the creation
and maintenance of the world and in the persons of the gods Atum and Re-Horakhty. . . .
[The city’s] principal feature was a temple devoted to Atum and Re-Horakhty, the precise location and shape of which is uncertain.” James P. Allen, “Heliopolis,” in Redford,
Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt, 2:88.
11. The name in Abraham’s day could have feasibly been simply *dd(w)-Ra, which
Joseph Smith rendered as the more familiar Potiphar in his translation. Compare the
observation in Kitchen, On the Reliability of the Old Testament, 347, on how the name
was linguistically updated in the story of Joseph in the book of Genesis, which both took
place chronologically and was composed centuries after Abraham’s day.

and Hathor are attested in this corpus (sometimes sporting a sun disc
above their heads).15 The picture presented in the Book of Abraham of
Abraham’s kinsfolk adopting elements of Egyptian solar religion into
their own native Chaldean worship of the sun deity Shagreel is therefore
plausible based on current evidence.16
But what is the significance of this cult site in the Book of Abraham
featuring a hill? “In the ancient civilizations from Egypt to India and
beyond, the mountain can be a center of fertility, the primeval hillock
of creation, the meeting place of the gods, the dwelling place of the high
god, the meeting place of heaven and earth, the monument effectively
upholding the order of creation, the place where god meets man, a place
of theophany.”17 As Nibley observed, the Book of Abraham appears
to link Potiphar’s Hill with this concept of the mythological primeval
hillock—the sacred Urhügel “marking the first land to emerge from
the great waters and the place where the sun first rose on the day of
creation.”18 The concept of “a mound of earth that emerged as the first
dry land when the primeval waters receded” was foundational to the
Egyptian view of the cosmos, being “one of the earliest known Egyptian
images of the creation.” So central was this idea in Egyptian religious
imagination that “many Egyptian temples had a mound of earth in their
sanctuary, which not only commemorated this primeval hill but which
also was viewed as the primeval mound.”19 The placement of an altar
next to a hill, as depicted in Abraham 1:10, thus fits nicely the pattern of
ancient ritual complexes.
Ancient Syrian-Levantine and Anatolian peoples shared a similar
conception of the cosmic mountain as a place of great cultic and mythic

rock outcropping or a spring, lent itself to the numinous.” Texts recovered at some of these sites “often refer to rituals taking place on mountains, which were considered, from early Hittite times, to be the place
where the presence of the celestial deities (especially the storm gods)
could be felt, and where special ceremonies devoted to their worship
were performed.”21 All of this is in harmony with the Book of Abraham’s
description of Potiphar’s Hill (Abr. 1:9–11), which is said to be a place of
syncretic Egyptian-Canaanite cultic activity (“made an offering unto the
god of Pharaoh, and also unto the god of Shagreel, even after the manner of the Egyptians”) that featured sacred architecture (“the altar,” “this
altar”) as well as a local priesthood (“priest of Pharaoh,” “the priests”).
It was also a place of revelation and theophany, since it was at this site
where Abraham was “filled with the vision of the Almighty” and delivered by Jehovah after “the priests laid violence upon [him], that they
might slay [him] also, as they did those virgins upon this altar” at the hill
(vv. 12, 15; compare vv. 15–19).

The Blood of the Canaanites
The first chapter of the Book of Abraham contains a short detail about
the ancestry of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt: “Now this king of Egypt
was a descendant from the loins of Ham, and was a partaker of the blood
of the Canaanites by birth. From this descent sprang all the Egyptians,
and thus the blood of the Canaanites was preserved in the land” (Abr.
1:21–22). Although he was a righteous man who “judged his people
wisely and justly all his days” (v. 26), Pharaoh could not lay claim to any
priesthood authority because of his ancestry (v. 27). This detail in the text
about the king of Egypt being “a partaker of the blood of the Canaanites”
may appear odd at first glance but might make some historical sense in a
specific way for Abraham’s time and circumstances.
The Egyptian Twelfth Dynasty ruled a unified Egypt for about
200 years from circa 1990 to circa 1800 BC. However, at the end of the
Twelfth Dynasty, control over Egypt was split between the Thirteenth
and Fourteenth Dynasties.1 The Thirteenth Dynasty rulers were native
Egyptians and generally continued carrying out the policies of the
Twelfth Dynasty. However, scholars have determined from their Semitic
names that the Fourteenth Dynasty rulers were likely not native Egyptians, but rather were probably natives of Syria-Palestine (Canaan).2
“[This] dynasty came into being when the Canaanite population in the
[Nile] Delta proclaimed its own ruler . . . after having gradually seceded

from the rest of Egypt during the late Twelfth Dynasty.”3 It could thus be
that Abraham had in mind the Asiatic or Semitic kings of the Fourteenth
Dynasty with his comment that the “king of Egypt . . . was a partaker of
the blood of the Canaanites.”
This, in turn, might help us narrow down a general range of dates
for Abraham’s life. According to the biblical account, Abraham lived
to be 175 years old (Gen. 25:7–8). If this figure is taken at face value,
and if as a young man Abraham lived toward the end of the Twelfth
Dynasty, perhaps during the reign of Pharaoh Amenemhat III (ca. 1860–
1814 BC),4 this would afford enough time to accommodate either the
early (ca. 1800 BC) or late (ca. 1730 BC) date for the commencement of
the Fourteenth Dynasty of Canaanite pharaohs.5
Admittedly, the biblical age of Abraham seems difficult to believe.
Adjusting Abraham’s lifespan to something more reasonable, such as his
nineties,6 would still put him in generally the right chronological window but would narrow that window by a few decades and would favor
the earlier over the later origin for the Fourteenth Dynasty. There are still
large gaps in the archaeological record for this period, and so establishing an incontrovertible chronology for Abraham’s life based on information from the Book of Abraham is not much more feasible beyond this.

5. The chronology of the Fourteenth Dynasty remains disputed because of “the brutal
truth . . . that there is no reliable anchor point for Egyptian history before the New Kingdom [ca. 1550–1069 BC].” As such, “the chronological position of the Fourteenth Dynasty
. . . has been a key problem in” reconstructing the history of the end of the Middle Kingdom and the beginning of the Second Intermediate Period. Harco Willems, “The First
Intermediate Period and the Middle Kingdom,” in A Companion to Ancient Egypt, ed.
Alan B. Lloyd, 2 vols. (West Sussex, U.K.: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), 1:81, 99. While most
Egyptologists accept a late date for the beginning of the Fourteenth Dynasty, Ryholt has
argued vigorously for an early date. See the opposing arguments in Ryholt, Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period; Daphna Ben-Tor, Susan J. Allen, and
James P. Allen, “Review: Seals and Kings,” Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental
Research 315 (1999): 47–74. While Ryholt’s position remains the minority view among
Egyptologists, his theory is nonetheless a viable interpretation of the scarce archaeological evidence that survives for this period.
6. Ancient people surviving to this old age is rare but attested. Pharaoh Ramesses II
(ca. 1300–1210 BC) lived to his nineties, for instance. See Kenneth A. Kitchen, Pharaoh

Phillips; Mississauga, Can.: Benben Publications, 1982), 206–7.

“Whether one dates the arrival of the Fourteenth Dynasty toward
the beginning or the end of the Thirteenth Dynasty, there would have
been a dynastic change during Abraham’s life, with rulers of a different
dynasty in Egypt at the time of his visit than had been in charge during
his attempted sacrifice.”7 Not only were these rulers indeed “partakers
of the blood of the Canaanites” as mentioned in the Book of Abraham,8
but they may have even had a friendly disposition toward Abraham on
account of their shared Semitic ancestry. This, in turn, might account
for why Abraham was granted royal privileges, such as the opportunity
to teach Pharaoh and his court astronomy (Facsimile 3). Even with a
number of remaining uncertainties that should temper our conclusions,
small textual details such as those at Abraham 1:21–22 might help us better narrow down a plausible historical timeline for Abraham and situate
the Book of Abraham in a plausible ancient context.

Zeptah and Egyptes
The Book of Abraham describes how “the land of Egypt [was] first discovered by a woman, who was the daughter of Ham, and the daughter of Egyptus” (Abr. 1:23). This woman “discovered the land [when] it
was under water, who afterward settled her sons in it; and thus, from
Ham, sprang that race which preserved the curse in the land.” Thereafter
“the first government of Egypt was established by Pharaoh, the eldest son
of Egyptus, the daughter of Ham” (vv. 24–25).
This genealogy in the Book of Abraham reflects the names of the
characters as printed in the March 1, 1842, issue of the Times and Seasons.1
Two of the names in this genealogy, however, are rendered differently in
the 1835 Kirtland-era Book of Abraham manuscripts. As has been long
recognized,2 the name of Ham’s wife in all three of the Kirtland-era manuscripts is either “Zep-tah” or “Zeptah” instead of Egyptus.3 Additionally, the name of Ham and Zeptah’s (or Egyptus’s) daughter is Egyptes in
the Kirtland-era manuscripts, as opposed to Egyptus.4 The name Zeptah
is striking because it could very likely be a rendering of the Egyptian

name Siptah (sA PtH), meaning “son of [the god] Ptah.”5 This name, as
well as its feminine equivalent “daughter of [the god] Ptah” (sAt PtH), is
attested during the likely time of Abraham.6 It is also the name of an
Egyptian king who lived many centuries after Abraham.7
The original pronunciation of Zeptah is unknown, since we have no
surviving indication of how Joseph Smith intended the name to be pronounced. Was the /e/ phoneme in the first syllable in Zeptah short (/ɛ/ as
in bed) or long (/iː/ as in keep or the name Egypt)? While impossible to
prove, /iː/ (“ZEE-Ptah”) would be more congruent with how sA (“son”) is
believed to have been pronounced in Middle Egyptian and how it is later
attested in Demotic.8 The spelling of the name with a Z instead of an S is
not a problem for the Book of Abraham, since in the Egyptian language
of Abraham’s time “these two consonants were pronounced the same, like
English s as in set.” They were “essentially one consonant in [the Egyptian
language of this time], and could often be written interchangeably,”9 having “become graphic variants of the same phoneme /s/.”10
The name Egyptes/Egyptus is clearly related to the name Egypt,
which comes from the Greek Aigyptos (Latin: Aegyptus). Aigyptos is a

Jacobus Van Dijk, “Ptah,” in The Ancient Gods Speak: A Guide to Egyptian Religion, ed.
Donald B. Redford (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002), 322. Among his other
attributes, Ptah was imagined early on as a craftsman and creator god and was later associated with Nun and Nunet, the godly personifications of the primeval waters of creation.

discovered by Zeptah and her family.

rendering of one of the Egyptian names for the ancient city of Memphis,
which contains the theophoric Ptah element (Hwt-kA-PtH; literally “the
estate of the Ka [spirit] of [the god] Ptah”).11 Since Egyptes/Egyptus is
a Greek name that would be anachronistic for Abraham’s day, it might
reflect the work of ancient scribes transmitting the text who “updated”
the name centuries later. This may likewise have been the case with the
name Zeptah as well.12
We don’t know for certain why Joseph Smith changed the names Zeptah and Egyptes when he published the Book of Abraham in 1842. The
change from Egyptes to Egyptus might easily be explained as the modern
scribe(s) for the Book of Abraham originally mishearing the name and
being corrected later.13 The change from Zeptah to Egyptus is harder to
explain. It could have been the result of scribe Willard Richards incorrectly copying the name shortly before the Book of Abraham was published.14 Another possibility is that the Prophet or one of his scribes who
read through the text of the Book of Abraham beforehand substituted a
more familiar name for the less familiar one to make it more consistent
with other names in the text.15

including place names and personal names. John H. Walton and D. Brent Sandy, The
Lost World of Scripture: Ancient Literary Culture and Biblical Authority (Downers Grove,

Saul’s sons are given as Ishbosheth and Mephibosheth in 2 Samuel but are rendered Eshbaal and Meribbaal in 1 Chronicles. While not all scholars agree on the meaning of this
divergence, many think the baal (as in the god Baal) element was deliberately replaced
by scribes with bosheth (the Hebrew word for “shame”). See the discussion in Michael
Avioz, “The Names Mephibosheth and Ishbosheth Reconsidered,” Journal of the Ancient
Near Eastern Society 32, no. 1 (2011): 11–20. City names might also be updated by scribes
so that the older name is given along with the name the city was known by at the time
the scribe was working. This is seen in Judges 18:29: “They named the city Dan, after
their ancestor Dan, who was born to Israel; but the name of the city was formerly Laish.”
Examples of Egyptian scribes actively “updating” and “expanding” the language of older
texts, including names and epithets, can also be cited. See, for instance, Emile Cole,

But why might a woman have a masculine name like Zeptah? There
are attested examples of the feminine -t ending dropping from names
that include sAt (“daughter”),16 and it could be that the same thing happened in the name Zeptah. Another possibility is that the name was
confused by ancient scribes copying the text after Abraham’s lifetime.
This seems to have happened before to other ancient Egyptian figures;
including, potentially, a male Egyptian king named Netjerkare Siptah
who lived before Abraham’s lifetime and who appears to have been mistaken as a beautiful woman for almost two thousand years because of
ancient scribal mistakes.17 Perhaps a similar problem happened when
the Book of Abraham was copied over the centuries.
Alternatively, Egyptologist Vivienne G. Callender argues that
Netjerkare Siptah was in fact a woman ruler named Neitikrety Siptah,
despite the masculine form of Siptah in her name.
Perhaps the presence of the phrase, ‘Son of Ptah’, . . . may have been a
specific tribute to the Memphite god, who was particularly prominent
at this time. The masculinity of this name . . . is not a problem for a
feminine ruler, because the masculine filiation, sA Ra [son of Re], was
later used by other female rulers, such as Sobekneferu, who fluctuated
between using male and female nomenclature. Sobekneferu, Hatshepsut and Tausret all used various forms of masculine display or titulary
when they were rulers, so, if she had been a female ruler, perhaps Neitikrety may have done the same, and the title, sA PtH, may have been used
to indicate that her monarchy was different from that of the other rulers
who used sA Ra in the Old Kingdom.18
If this argument is correct, then we would have an attested ancient
Egyptian female personality using precisely the same masculine name as
makes sense, because “Joseph Smith was translating the papyrus into English for readers
who were already commonly familiar with this nomenclature.” Clark, Story of the Pearl
of Great Price, 127, emphasis in original. Another possibility is that the change was made
because the Prophet or one of his clerks had come to view Zeptah and Egyptes as the same
person. The story seems to still work if they are viewed as the same person, but the textual
history makes it seem more likely that these are two different women. For another proposed explanation for this change, see Brent Lee Metcalfe, “The Curious Textual History
of ‘Egyptus’ the Wife of Ham,” John Whitmer Historical Association Journal 34, no. 2 (Fall/
Winter 2014): 1–11.

in the Book of Abraham. This is mentioned not to positively identify the
Book of Abraham’s Zeptah with any of these other ancient figures, but
rather to note the attestation of the name itself and the phenomenon of
women potentially bearing masculine names or titles. So while we may
not be able to currently answer these questions entirely, what can be said
is that the name Zeptah in the Book of Abraham is, arguably, authentically Egyptian.

The Name of the Lord
On two occasions in the Book of Abraham, the Lord reveals to Abraham his true name: Jehovah. The first incident was when Abraham
had a “vision of the Almighty,” wherein “the angel of [the Lord’s] presence”
rescued him from being sacrificed in Ur of the Chaldees and made early
allusions to a future covenant relationship (Abr. 1:15). “And his voice was
unto me: Abraham, Abraham, behold, my name is Jehovah, and I have
heard thee, and have come down to deliver thee, and to take thee away
from thy father’s house, and from all thy kinsfolk, into a strange land
which thou knowest not of ” (Abr. 1:16, emphasis added). It was on this
occasion that the Lord informed Abraham, “Behold, I will lead thee by
my hand, and I will take thee, to put upon thee my name, even the Priesthood of thy father, and my power shall be over thee. As it was with Noah
so shall it be with thee; but through thy ministry my name shall be known
in the earth forever, for I am thy God” (Abr. 1:18–19, emphasis added).
The second occasion when the Lord revealed his true name was when
he made a covenant with Abraham. In the preamble to the covenant,1
the Lord instructed Abraham:
Arise, and take Lot with thee; for I have purposed to take thee away out
of Haran, and to make of thee a minister to bear my name in a strange
land which I will give unto thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession, when they hearken to my voice. For I am the Lord thy God; I dwell
in heaven; the earth is my footstool; I stretch my hand over the sea, and
it obeys my voice; I cause the wind and the fire to be my chariot; I say
to the mountains—Depart hence—and behold, they are taken away by
a whirlwind, in an instant, suddenly. My name is Jehovah, and I know
1. See “The Abrahamic Covenant,” 121–24 herein.

the end from the beginning; therefore my hand shall be over thee (Abr.
2:6–8, emphasis added).
Among the promises made to Abraham was that his “name [would be
made] great among all nations” should he be true to God’s covenant and
that “through [his] name” would all the nations of the earth be blessed;
“for as many as receive this Gospel shall be called after [Abraham’s] name”
(Abr. 2:9–10). Upon hearing the Lord’s true name of Jehovah for a second time, Abraham thereafter “called again upon the name of the Lord”
in ritual activity (Abr. 2:20, emphasis added), whereas before he had
merely called on the Lord (for example, Abr. 1:15; 2:6, 18).
Why is it significant that the Lord twice revealed his true name to
Abraham, and why is there a running motif on the importance of names
throughout the text?2 Reading these passages in an ancient Near Eastern (and especially ancient Egyptian) context helps answer this question.
James P. Allen explains,
Names were much more important to the Egyptians than they are in
our society. They were thought to be essential parts of their owners. . . .
This is why Egyptians who could afford to do so expended a great deal
of effort and resources ensuring that their names would continue to
survive in their tombs and on their monuments—and conversely, why
the names of some individuals were hacked out of their monuments by
their enemies after death. Even during life, people could be essentially
deprived of existence by banning their names.3
Names were especially important for royalty. Ronald J. Leprohon
observes,
Choosing a particular name was an especially symbolic act for an
ancient Egyptian ruler, since names were so significant within the culture. After all, the original act of creation by the primeval god himself
was inextricably linked to the act of naming the various entities he created. Kings wished their names to “remain” (mn) and be “enduring”
(wAH), or for posterity to “give thanks to god” (dwA nTr) in their name.
A king could also make his name “perfect” (nfr) through “combat” (aHA),
which cemented his reputation as a “brave warrior” (qn) in “every country.” And that reputation could then be circulated by a court official
2. Compare Abraham 3:3, 13, where Kolob and other astronomical bodies are named,
as well as Abraham 5:20–21, where Adam gives names to the animals.

Hieroglyphs, 3rd ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2014), 101.
The Name of the Lord 109
who “established” (smn) or “caused to live” (sanx) his lord’s name. In fact,
courtiers were urged to “fight” (aHA) on behalf of their sovereign’s name.4
The importance of names was such that the Egyptian monarch
adopted multiple names and titles. According to Leprohon, “since the
king was a human being who held a divine office as well as the link
between his subjects and the gods, the royal court wished to express the
essential features of this unique circumstance. One of the ways it accomplished this was by composing special epithets that the king assumed at
his accession, which would serve as a brief statement of his qualities or
of his relationship with the divine and the terrestrial world.”5
Besides his or her birth name, the monarch adopted four other
names that were associated with important deities and announced his or
her splendor, divinity, and royal attributes.6
Fundamental to the ancient Egyptian mindset was the idea that
names were “an intrinsic element and source of power.”7 Because “divinities were often said to have secret names guarded from devotees and
other deities alike,”8 knowing and properly invoking the name of a deity
in magical and ritual recitals was therefore crucial in making the performance work. As Egyptologist David Silverman wrote, “To know the
name of an individual was to have some control over him or her. . . . The
same dynamics surrounded the names of deities. Once the force/power
was identified and given a name, prayers and offerings could be made to
it; it could be worshipped by name; it could be invoked, implored, even
feared and adored. To know the name of a god was to gain some advantage or control over the powers it represented.”9
This belief is captured in one ancient Egyptian tale where the sun
god Re conceals his true name (even from his daughter, the goddess Isis)
to prevent others from magically using it against him. Through clever

trickery, Isis learns the true name of her father, Re, and thereafter uses it
to cure him from a snakebite.10
Names held significant religious importance to the ancient Israelites
and to other ancient Near Eastern peoples as well.11 “Throughout the Bible,
names are full of meaning. . . . For ancient Israel and the ancient Near East
as well as for early Judaism and Christianity, the name of a person, place,
or thing was somehow connected to and descriptive of its essence and/or
personality.”12 Abraham himself and his wife, Sarai, both received new
names when they entered into a covenant with God. “As for me, behold, my
covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations. Neither
shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham;
for a father of many nations have I made thee. . . . As for Sarai thy wife, thou
shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be” (Gen. 17:4–5, 15).
In Genesis, the patriarch Jacob received his new name of Israel after wrestling
a divine messenger who himself refused to disclose his name (Gen. 32:22–32).
In Exodus, Moses received his prophetic commission to rescue the children
of Israel from Egyptian bondage only after he received a revelation of the
Lord’s true name on the “mountain of God” (Ex. 3:1, 13–15).
The latter episode is especially germane to the revelation of the Lord’s
true name to Abraham in the Book of Abraham since in both instances
the revelation informed the prophet of deeper truths about the relationship God has with his covenant people. In the book of Exodus,
God reveals the divine name of YWHW [Jehovah] to Moses (Exod. 3:6;
6:2). God acknowledges a special relationship with Moses as the God of
his father (Exod. 3:6), who created a covenant with his ancestors (Exod.
6:4). God promises to be with Moses in a unique and intimate way
(Exod. 3:12; 7:1), and clarifies that the commission of Moses as liberator
is because YHWH also has a special relationship with Israel (Exod. 3:8;
6:7–8). The two commissions [of Moses in Exodus 3:1–4:17 and 6:1–7:7]
provide the foundation for the development of Israelite religion in the
wilderness.13

The Name of the Lord 111
Not unlike the Egyptian evidence seen above, by knowing the true name
of God through revelation, Moses could, in effect, divine its deeper symbolic meaning and tap into its divine power.14 Sigmund Mowinckel notes,
In the opinion of the ancient Israelites names were symbolic. . . . Symbolic not only with regard to their actual and literal signification, but
also with regard to all the symbolic meanings that might be found in
them. . . . To find the deeper, hidden meaning of the names of the gods
was one of the tasks of the “theologians” of those days. A man who
knows the “real” deeper meaning of the name of a god, really “knows
the god” in question. . . . What [Exodus 3] tells us is that this deeper
meaning of the name was revealed to Moses by God himself. Moses
at once understands that the mysterious words refer to the name of
Yahweh [Jehovah], and also that the god who speaks to him from the
burning bush and can reveal the hidden meaning of the Name, must
certainly be Yahweh himself, and such a revelation is sufficient proof
that Yahweh has sent him.15
To be sure, the Lord did not reveal his true name to Abraham so that
the patriarch could manipulate or control him, as it was expected one
could do in ancient Egyptian magical practice. Rather, as read in the
context of Abraham’s narrative, the Lord disclosed his true name in a
sacred, intimate covenant setting for the purpose of blessing the nations
of the earth. Nonetheless, the text does indicate that after the Lord’s
name was revealed to Abraham, he was able to invoke it in the performance of covenant rituals, thereby making those rituals potent and the
covenant binding.16
Knowing something about the religious, mythical, and symbolic significance of names in the world of the ancient Near East thus helps us
14. Compare Exodus 20:24 and 23:13, where the Lord instructs that invoking his
name in ritual contexts will ensure blessings and forbids the names of other gods from
being invoked. “On the one hand, invoking the name of Yahweh results in his presence
and blessing, but on the other hand, a warning and threat are given against invoking the
name of other gods.” John Van Seters, A Law Book for the Diaspora: Revision in the Study
of the Covenant Code (New York: Oxford University Press, 2003), 62.

Annual 32 (1961): 125–26.
16. On this point, it is also significant that gods were invoked as witnesses in covenant treaties between ancient Near Eastern potentates. So too were Jehovah and the
host of heaven invoked as witnesses in biblical texts. Donald L. Magnetti, “Function of
the Oath in the Ancient Near Eastern International Treaty,” American Journal of International Law 72, no. 4 (October 1978): 815, 818, 821–22, 824–26; David E. Bokovoy, “Invoking the Council as Witnesses in Amos 3:13,” Journal of Biblical Literature 127, no. 1 (Spring

understand why the Lord revealed his name to Abraham in this specific
narrative and theological framework. It also provides an ancient context
that makes sense of Abraham’s account. The Lord revealed his true name
to ratify his covenant with Abraham and to make the attending priesthood power efficacious: “Behold, I will lead thee by my hand, and I will
take thee, to put upon thee my name, even the Priesthood of thy father,
and my power shall be over thee” (Abr. 1:18; compare Abr. 2:9, 11).

Abraham’s Converts in Haran
I
n the Genesis account of Abraham’s sojourning, the text indicates
that at the outset of his journey the patriarch “took Sarai his wife,
and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth
to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came”
(Gen. 12:5). This passage is paralleled in the Book of Abraham, with
one small but important difference. It reads, “And I took Sarai, whom
I took to wife when I was in Ur, in Chaldea, and Lot, my brother’s son,
and all our substance that we had gathered, and the souls that we had
won in Haran, and came forth in the way to the land of Canaan, and
dwelt in tents as we came on our way” (Abr. 2:15, emphasis added). As
Hugh Nibley rightly recognized, the Book of Abraham thus portrays
the patriarch as an exemplary missionary (compare Abr. 1:7).1
At first glance, the phrase in Genesis 12:5 (“and the souls that they had
gotten in Haran”) could appear to be depicting the patriarch’s acquisition of bonded servants or slaves.2 This, however, is not the only possible

Works of Hugh Nibley 18 (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book; Provo: Foundation for Ancient

2. Thus, Robert Alter, who renders verse 5 so: “And Abram took Sarai his wife and
Lot his nephew and all the goods they had gotten and the folk they had bought in Haran,
and they set out on the way to the land of Canaan, and they came to the land of Canaan.”
Although Alter believes this verse depicts Abraham’s involvement in slavery, he stresses
that the sort of slavery practiced in the Bible (and throughout much of the ancient Near
East) “was not the sort of chattel slavery later practiced in North America. These slaves
had certain limited rights, could be given great responsibility, and were not thought
to lose their personhood.” Robert Alter, The Hebrew Bible, Volume 1: The Five Books of
Moses, a Translation with Commentary (New York: W. W. Norton, 2019), 41.

interpretation of this somewhat obscure passage. The Hebrew word rendered “substance” in the KJV (rĕkûš) means something more like “property” and usually refers to cattle and herds but also seems to apply to the
household and its members (compare Gen. 31:18; 36:6; 46:6).3 It appears
to derive from an Akkadian word that as a verb (rakāsu) means “to bind”
and as a noun (riksu) means both a “band, belt,” and an “agreement,
treaty.”4 In other words, it could be referring to those in Haran whom
Abraham and his family bound by covenant. In this regard, the “conversion” of members of the local community at Haran may have looked
something like the attitude Ruth, a Moabite, adopted when she pledged
loyalty to her mother-in-law, Naomi, an Israelite: “Whither thou goest,
I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my
people, and thy God my God” (Ruth 1:16).
As Nibley has noted and discussed,5 there is a long, sustained
interpretative tradition within Judaism (and later Islam) that reads
Genesis 12:5 in exactly this manner.6 In Targum Neofiti and Targum
Pseudo-Jonathan (Aramaic translations and expansions of the Bible),
for example, Genesis 12:5 is rendered to read that Abraham “converted”
or “made proselytes” (gyyr) of the inhabitants of Haran.7 In Targum
Onqelos, the residents of Haran are depicted as having been “subjected
to the Law” (šaʿăbiydu lǝʾorāytāʾ) by Abraham and are thus counted as
his converts.8 The Targumic interpreters, accordingly, understood Genesis 12:5 exactly as depicting “the proselytizing activity of Abraham.”9

Abraham’s Converts in Haran 115
This interpretation was continued into the rabbinic period10 and was
notably picked up in texts such as the Bereshit Rabbah (Lekh Lekha
39:14) and the Zohar (Lekh Lekha 1:85b).11
In his commentary on the book of Genesis, the Jewish scholar
Umberto Cassuto argued that the “souls” (“lives,” “persons”; nepeš) of
Genesis 12:5 could not be slaves for a variety of reasons; he preferred
to follow the rabbinic interpretation that the passage offers “an allusion to proselytes (Abram converted the men, and Sarah the women).”
He postulated that the rabbinic interpretation “approximates to the
actual meaning of the text” and, what’s more, “that we have here one of
those verses that point to the theme of an ancient tradition that was not
indeed incorporated in the Torah in its entirety, but was known to the
Israelites.”12 Strikingly, Cassuto’s own translation of Genesis 12:5 parallels the Book of Abraham almost exactly: “And the souls that they had
won in Haran.”13
The subtle change in the Book of Abraham’s parallel passage to Genesis 12:5, accordingly, finds support both from ancient sources and from
modern scholarship. Beyond this, the text provides greater insight to the
life of Abraham for the appreciation of Latter-day Saints: the patriarch
was a great missionary who was concerned with extending the blessings
of the covenant to God’s children, as was part of the obligations of the
covenant he took upon himself (compare Gal. 3:6–9; Abr. 1:1–3; 2:9–11).
As Elder George Reynolds recognized, “Thus we find that Abraham, having sought for the privilege of becoming a preacher of righteousness, in
answer to his desire the priesthood was given to him with the command
to magnify it. It is not probable that such a man would fail in the hour

The Plains of Moreh
The second chapter of the Book of Abraham parallels content found
in Genesis 12. Both texts narrate the patriarch’s flight into Canaan
and provide specific geographic details about the route he and his family
took as they fled Haran (Abr. 2:14–18; Gen. 12:4–9). The Book of Abraham describes Abraham as “journey[ing] from Haran by the way of Jershon, to come to the land of Canaan” (Abr. 2:16).1 Thereafter, Abraham
and his party “passed from Jershon through the land unto the place of
Sechem” (Abr. 2:18).2 This Sechem, the text says, “was situated in the
plains of Moreh,” which themselves were located within “the borders of
the land of the Canaanites.” Here Abraham “offered sacrifice . . . in the
plains of Moreh, and called on the Lord devoutly.” He did this, he says,
because he discovered that the land of Canaan was an “idolatrous nation”
(Abr. 2:18). As read in both Genesis and the Book of Abraham, it is here
that Abraham received a theophany of the Lord with the promise “unto
thy seed will I give this land” (Abr. 2:19; compare Gen. 12:7).
One of these named toponyms deserves special comment. The mention of the plains of Moreh at Abraham 2:18 corresponds to the plain
(singular) of Moreh named at KJV Genesis 12:6 (compare Deut. 11:30).
As scholars have long recognized, however, the rendering of “plain” in
1. The location of this Jershon is unknown and not mentioned in the corresponding
chapter, Genesis 12. From the description in the text, it appears to lie somewhere between
Haran in northern Mesopotamia and Canaan, placing it, probably, somewhere in modern
Syria or Lebanon. Obviously, this Jershon should not be confused with the New World
Jershon of the Book of Mormon (Alma 27:22–24).

the KJV is an error.3 The Hebrew word mistranslated as “plain” in the
KJV (ʾēlôn) actually means “oak” or “terebinth.”4 Even the name “Moreh”
(rendered in both Genesis and the Book of Abraham as a proper noun)
might more technically be rendered “oracle, diviner, teacher” in order
to produce a name like “the teacher’s terebinth” or “the oracle oak” for
the location.5 It would appear that with “plains of Moreh,” Joseph Smith
was following the KJV in his own rendering of Abraham 2:18. That the
Prophet would at times follow the KJV in his translation of the Book of
Abraham is not surprising given the dependence on the KJV seen in his
translation of the Book of Mormon.6
Although the Book of Abraham follows the KJV with the lessaccurate rendition of this passage, it nevertheless departs from the KJV
in a subtle and significant way. As mentioned above, the Book of Abraham explicitly mentions that upon arriving at Sechem in the plains of
Moreh—the first named location in Canaan—Abraham was shocked to
discover that the land of Canaan was an “idolatrous nation” (Abr. 2:18).
This detail is left unmentioned in the KJV, which merely notes that “the
Canaanite was then in the land” (Gen. 12:6). This idolatry prompted
Abraham to offer sacrifices and call on the Lord, details once again missing from Genesis.7
How is this significant for the Book of Abraham? As multiple scholars have observed, it is very likely that the “oak of Moreh” (the “oracle

oak”) was a local Canaanite cult site—that is, a sacred or holy tree that
functioned as an oracular shrine or Canaanite sanctuary.8 “The oak of
Moreh clearly belonged to the cultic center at Shechem. . . . The name
of the oak . . . suggests that it functioned as an oracular tree.”9 It was,
in effect, “a site of divination.”10 Speiser notes that one ancient Jewish
source, Targum Onqelos, recognized this and so rendered ʾēlôn as “plain”
(Aramaic: meyšar) instead of “oak,” probably to “avoid the pagan implications of a sacred tree.”11
The Book of Abraham’s added detail about the patriarch’s encounter
with Canaanite idolatry also reinforces the point made by Matthew L.
Bowen: “Substantial parts of Genesis 12–22 [and Abraham 2] illustrate
how Abraham ‘templifies’ the Promised Land—its re-creation as sacred
space—by Abraham’s building altars at Shechem, Mamre/Hebron,
Bethel, and Moriah.”12 As told in the Book of Abraham, the idolatry
Abraham confronted at the plains (oak) of Moreh near Shechem in
Canaan prompted him to consecrate the land by erecting an altar. This
he would repeat, as Bowen notes, at other Canaanite locations according to the biblical record (Gen. 12:7–8; 13:4, 18; 22:9). In response, the
Lord appeared to Abraham and offered him his own (true) oracle about

“oracle oak” (Abr. 2:19; Gen. 12:7).13
None of this is obvious from reading the King James translation
of Genesis 12. So even if the translation of the Book of Abraham is
in some degree dependent on the KJV, the underlying narrative captures something deeper and more authentic to the ancient world of
Abraham.

The Abrahamic Covenant
One of the important doctrinal contributions of the Book of Abraham is its elaboration on the nature of the Abrahamic covenant
(Abr. 2:6–11).1 While some details about the Abrahamic covenant can
be read in the book of Genesis (12:1–5; compare 26:1–4, 24; 28; 35:9–13;
48:3–4), it is in the Book of Abraham where additional important aspects
about this covenant are revealed. The main significance of the Abrahamic
covenant as expanded upon in the Book of Abraham is that it involves
a “right to the priesthood . . . as the essence of Abraham’s inheritance.”2
Indeed, the covenant Abraham entered into with God, according to the
text, encompassed specific blessings and priesthood responsibilities and
included a charge to Abraham’s descendants to share the gospel with all
the families of the earth.

Also significant is that the Abrahamic covenant, as presented in the
Book of Abraham, “has several features that appear in other covenants
and treaties of the ancient world. Treaties and covenants in Abraham’s
day typically have a preamble or title, stipulations, an oath or other
solemn ceremony, and, more rarely, curses conditional on violation of
the covenant. . . . The covenant in the Book of Abraham follows the
pattern for Abraham’s day.”3 This should not come as a surprise, since
God communicates with his children “after the manner of their language, that they might come to understanding” (D&C 1:24; compare
2 Ne. 31:3).4 So if Abraham were to enter into a covenant with God, it
would not be unusual for the structure of that covenant to resemble the
way people made covenants and treaties in his day, or at the very least
for Abraham to have understood and structured his covenant with God
in those terms.
With this in mind, and thanks to the comparative data uncovered by
scholars over the past century that help us better understand the form
and content of ancient covenants,5 the Abrahamic covenant as depicted
in the Book of Abraham can be structured as follows:
Ancient Covenant Pattern Abraham 2:6–11
Solemn Ceremony But I, Abraham, and Lot, my brother’s son, prayed
unto the Lord, and the Lord appeared unto me, and
said unto me:
Preamble Arise, and take Lot with thee; for I have purposed to
take thee away out of Haran, and to make of thee a
minister to bear my name in a strange land which
I will give unto thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession, when they hearken to my voice. For
I am the Lord thy God; I dwell in heaven; the earth is
my footstool; I stretch my hand over the sea, and it
obeys my voice; I cause the wind and the fire to be my
chariot; I say to the mountains—Depart hence—and
behold, they are taken away by a whirlwind, in an
instant, suddenly. My name is Jehovah, and I know
the end from the beginning; therefore my hand shall
be over thee.

The Abrahamic Covenant 123
Ancient Covenant Pattern Abraham 2:6–11
Stipulations And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless
thee above measure, and make thy name great among
all nations, and thou shalt be a blessing unto thy seed
after thee, that in their hands they shall bear this ministry and Priesthood unto all nations; and I will bless
them through thy name; for as many as receive this
Gospel shall be called after thy name, and shall be
accounted thy seed, and shall rise up and bless thee,
as their father; and I will bless them that bless thee, and
curse them that curse thee; and in thee (that is, in thy
Priesthood) and in thy seed (that is, thy Priesthood), for
I give unto thee a promise that this right shall continue
in thee, and in thy seed after thee (that is to say, the literal seed, or the seed of the body) shall all the families
of the earth be blessed, even with the blessings of the
Gospel, which are the blessings of salvation, even of
life eternal.
This structure helps make sense of the content of Abraham’s covenant and shows that “the covenant in the Book of Abraham follows the
pattern of treaties and covenants in his day.”6 So while the content of
the Abrahamic covenant is what is most important for Latter-day Saints
today,7 the form or structure of the covenant as depicted in the Book of
Abraham is one way the text can be grounded in the ancient world from
which it purports to derive.

Did Abraham Lie about His Wife, Sarai?
Before he journeyed into Egypt, Abraham was instructed by God:
“Behold, Sarai [later Sarah], thy wife, is a very fair woman to look
upon; therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see her,
they will say—she is his wife; and they will kill you, but they will save
her alive; therefore see that ye do on this wise: Let her say unto the Egyptians, she is thy sister, and thy soul shall live” (Abr. 2:22–23).
This passage is paralleled in Genesis 12:10–13.1 The rationale behind
Abraham’s actions is clear enough. He was fearful that Sarai’s beauty
would endanger him when the couple arrived in a strange, foreign land.
A key difference between the accounts in Genesis and the Book of Abraham, however, is that the Book of Abraham portrays God as instructing
Abraham to engage in the subterfuge, a detail not found in the Genesis
account. The question that naturally arises is whether Abraham was lying
by saying Sarai was his sister instead of his wife,2 and, if he was, whether
that lie was morally justified.3 Some readers of the Book of Abraham are
1. This so-called “sister/wife” motif is picked up again at Genesis 20:1–18 and Genesis
26:6–11 but involves different characters. For some perspective on this motif, see Gaye

especially troubled by what appears to be God commanding Abraham
to lie.
One important thing to keep in mind is that Genesis 20:12 identifies Sarai as Abraham’s half-sister. “So it is at least possible that Sarah
belonged to Abraham’s extended family and was thus considered to be
his ‘sister’ in the sense of a near blood relative.”4 With this in mind, Abraham appears to have been using somewhat ambiguous terminology and
not necessarily making an outright false statement.5 This ambiguous
language may also have been playing on Mesopotamian legal definitions,
but this point is debated.6
Whether or not this tactic would have played well in a Mesopotamian context, it would have worked in ancient Egyptian, since in that
language “a wife was often called the ‘sister’ (snt) of her husband, but
not because they had the same parents: instead, the term was one of
only morally permissible but perhaps even expedient and challenges the assumption
that lying is always or categorically immoral. Boyce’s argument deserves to be carefully
evaluated on its philosophical merits (something which falls outside the scope of this
treatment that focuses on the ancient context for Abraham’s life). For now, one thing we
might be able to say is that the evidence adduced here helps us better understand that
Abraham’s actions in his ancient cultural setting may not necessarily be at odds with
Boyce’s moral argumentation and may in fact complement it. Contrary to Boyce, “Why
Abraham Was Not Wrong to Lie,” 6–7, we do not necessarily see how his moral arguments for the rightness of Abraham’s lie obviate the need to first consider the patriarch’s
words and actions in their immediate ancient setting.

6. Older scholarship favored reading the sister-wife motif in Genesis in light of the
discoveries of Mesopotamian legal texts that seemed to indicate that a man could legally
adopt his wife as a sister to further ensure marital security. See, for example, E. A. Speiser,
Genesis, The Anchor Yale Bible (New York: Doubleday, 1964), 91–94; and Nahum M.
Sarna, Understanding Genesis: The World of the Bible in the Light of History (New York:
Schocken Books, 1970), 102–3. This reading and understanding of the Mesopotamian
legal material, however, would later be challenged. See, for instance, Samuel Greengus,
“Sisterhood Adoption at Nuzi and the ‘Wife-Sister’ in Genesis,” Hebrew Union College
Annual 46, Centennial Issue (1975): 5–31; Iain Provan, V. Philips Long, and Tremper
Longman III, A Biblical History of Israel (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 2003),

affection, indicating that the family relationship between husband and
wife by marriage was as close as that between real brother and sister.”7
This appears to reinforce the point that Abraham could be viewed as taking advantage of an ambiguity that would have worked especially well
in thwarting the murderous intentions of the Egyptians. “The custom
of referring to one’s wife (hm.t) as one’s sister (sn.t)” in ancient Egyptian culture therefore takes on deep significance for this passage. “For
an Egyptian audience, Abram’s calling Sarai his sister would not have
precluded her being his wife.”8
Finally, it is noteworthy that a text from the Dead Sea Scrolls called
the Genesis Apocryphon depicts Abraham being warned in a dream
of the danger he faced when traveling into Egypt because of Sarai’s
beauty. This in turn prompted his equivocation with Pharaoh.9 While
this text does not overtly say that God told Abraham to “lie” about his
relationship with Sarai, it heavily implies that he was divinely forewarned of the situation. This harmonizes nicely with the account in the
Book of Abraham.

Abraham the Seer
A careful reading of the Book of Abraham reveals subtle literary and
narrative elements in the text that might otherwise go unappreciated. For instance, a running leitmotif—a recurring theme or concept—throughout the Book of Abraham is that of Abraham as a seer,
or someone who sees or otherwise has a visual interaction with divine
manifestation (typically or usually aided by a divinatory device such as
a seer stone).1 As seen in both the mention of Abraham’s possession and
use of the Urim and Thummim (Abr. 3:1) as well as the repeated use of
verbs such as see and show (in their various forms), the Book of Abraham captures this imagery in both explicit and subtle ways.
The very first verse of the Book of Abraham launches this leitmotif that is carried throughout the text: “In the land of the Chaldeans, at
the residence of my fathers, I, Abraham, saw that it was needful for me
to obtain another place of residence” (Abr. 1:1, emphasis added). This is
emphasized again when the Lord instructs, “Abraham, get thee out of
thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a
land that I will show thee” (Abr. 2:3, emphasis added). Rather than haphazardly deciding to find a new land of promise on a whim, Abraham is
depicted instead as having the visionary foresight to relocate.
The third chapter of the Book of Abraham greatly expands on this
leitmotif as it narrates Abraham’s vision of the cosmos and the premortal world. As mentioned, the text overtly mentions that Abraham
had a seer’s instrument (the Urim and Thummim), which he consulted to communicate with God. “And I, Abraham, had the Urim and
1. In the Latter-day Saint canon, seers are defined as those who use divinely prepared
stones to receive communication from God, primarily for the purpose of translating
sacred records. See, for example, Mosiah 8:13–17; JS–H 1:34–35.
130 BYU Studies Quarterly
Thummim, which the Lord my God had given unto me, in Ur of the
Chaldees; and I saw the stars, that they were very great, and that one of
them was nearest unto the throne of God; and there were many great
ones which were near unto it” (Abr. 3:1–2, emphasis added). Verbs of
seeing or revelation that trigger the leitmotif are employed throughout
the rest of the chapter (and in Abraham’s vision of Creation) following
these introductory verses:
“And the Lord said unto me: Now, Abraham, these two facts exist,
behold thine eyes see it” (Abr. 3:6, emphasis added).
“Thus I, Abraham, talked with the Lord, face to face, as one man talketh with another; and he told me of the works which his hands had made;
and he said unto me: My son, my son (and his hand was stretched out),
behold I will show you all these. And he put his hand upon mine eyes,
and I saw those things which his hands had made, which were many;
and they multiplied before mine eyes, and I could not see the end thereof ”
(Abr. 3:11–12, emphasis added).2
“And the Lord said unto me: Abraham, I show these things unto thee
before ye go into Egypt, that ye may declare all these words” (Abr. 3:15,
emphasis added).
“If two things exist, and there be one above the other, there shall
be greater things above them; therefore Kolob is the greatest of all the
Kokaubeam that thou hast seen, because it is nearest unto me” (Abr. 3:16,
emphasis added).
“I rule in the heavens above, and in the earth beneath, in all wisdom
and prudence, over all the intelligences thine eyes have seen from the
beginning; I came down in the beginning in the midst of all the intelligences thou hast seen. Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the
intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all
these there were many of the noble and great ones; and God saw these
souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he
said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were
spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham,
2. Intriguingly, in 1893, Charles Lowell Walker preserved the testimony of a certain John Alger, who related that Joseph Smith informed him (Alger) in 1835 that during the First Vision God the Father physically touched Joseph’s eyes, whereupon the
Prophet beheld Jesus Christ. A. Karl Larson and Katharine Miles Larson, eds., Diary
of Charles Lowell Walker, 2 vols. (Logan: Utah State University Press, 1980), 2:755–56.
Although the reliability of this account is diminished by it being a late, thirdhand reminiscence, the parallel with the Lord touching Abraham’s eyes at Abraham 3:12 is somewhat remarkable.
Abraham the Seer 131
thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born” (Abr.
3:21–23, emphasis added).
“Now I, Abraham, saw that it was after the Lord’s time, which was after
the time of Kolob; for as yet the Gods had not appointed unto Adam his
reckoning” (Abr. 5:13, emphasis added).
This depiction of the patriarch as a seer is congruent with a similar
motif in the book of Genesis. As summarized by Everett Fox, Genesis
also utilizes the language of perception and vision (specifically the verb
raʾah, “to see”) in the Abrahamic narrative cycle.
At the outset of Abraham’s journey to Canaan, which signals his entry
into biblical tradition as an independent personality, God sends him
off to a land that he will “let him see” (12:1). Arriving in the land, Abraham is granted a communication from God, expressed by the phrase
“YHWH was seen by Avram . . .” (12:7). God subsequently promises the
land to him and his descendants (“see from the place that you are . . . for
all the land that you see, to you I give it and to your seed, for the ages”
[13:15]). “Seeing” comes to the fore in the story of Abraham’s concubine
Hagar; her encounter with God’s messenger ends with her addressing
a “God of Seeing” (16:13). Further meetings between Abraham and
God (17:1, 18:1) likewise express themselves visually, with the latter
scene, where God announces Isaac’s impending birth at Abraham’s tent,
almost unique in the Bible for its bold picture of God appearing directly
to human beings.3
The Jewish philosopher Martin Buber identified seven revelations to
Abraham in the Genesis account that lead with the theme of the patriarch seeing or beholding God or otherwise perceiving some crucial
information pertaining to God’s covenant:4
“Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and
from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will
shew thee” (Gen. 12:1, emphasis added).
“And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I
give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared
unto him” (Gen. 12:7, emphasis added).
“And the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from
him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art

northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward” (Gen. 13:14,
emphasis added).
“After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision,
saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.”
(Gen. 15:1, emphasis added).
“And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared
to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me,
and be thou perfect” (Gen. 17:1, emphasis added).
“And the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat
in the tent door in the heat of the day” (Gen. 18:1, emphasis added).
“And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham,
and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am. And he
said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get
thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering
upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. . . . Then on the third
day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off ” (Gen. 22:1–2,
4, emphasis added).
As Buber elaborates, the first six revelations culminate with the seventh—the binding of Isaac in the land of Moriah (Gen. 22:2),5 which
Abraham renames Jehovah-jireh (Gen. 22:14; “Jehovah will see”; yhwhyirĕʾeh). This new name is given to the site after the angel of the Lord
calls out Abraham’s name (Gen. 22:11; compare Abr. 1:15–16) and after
the latter lifts up his eyes to see the ram caught in a thicket, which acts as
a substitute sacrifice (Gen. 22:13).
In the saving moment [Abraham] lifts up his eyes and sees the ram.
And now he proclaims over the altar the name that makes known the
imperishable essence of this place, Mount Moriah: YHVH Will See. . . .
God sees man, and man sees God. God sees Abraham, and tests him by
seeing him as the righteous and “whole” man who walks before his God,
and now, at the end of his road, he conquers even this final place, the
holy temple mountain [compare 2 Chr. 3:1], by acting on God’s behalf.
Abraham sees God with the eye of his action and so recognizes Him. . . .
The mutual relationship of the one making the demands, who makes
them only in order to bless, and of the one making the sacrifice and
receiving the highest blessing in the moment of the greatest readiness
5. The name Moriah might derive from mrʾh (“sight, vision”) or might otherwise be
related to the verb raʾah. If so, this would make the name of the location, appropriately,
the “land of vision.” E. A. Speiser, Genesis, The Anchor Yale Bible (New York: Doubleday,
1964), 163; and R. W. L. Moberly, The Bible, Theology, and Faith: A Study of Abraham and
Jesus (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), 111–12.
Abraham the Seer 133
to sacrifice, here appears as the reciprocity of seeing. God sees the
innermost reality of the human soul; and man sees the way of God, so
that he may walk in His footsteps. The man sees, and sees also that he
is being seen.6
It is for this reason that Buber feels it appropriate to afford Abraham
the title of seer. “Abraham sees God with the eye of his action and so
recognizes Him. . . . Abraham becomes a prophet, but a seer is what he
was from the very first moment when God ‘let Himself be seen.’”7 The
running theme of Abraham as a seer adds a level of depth and narrative sophistication to both the Genesis account and the account of Abraham’s stargazing in the Book of Abraham.

Abrahamic Astronomy
The Book of Abraham is noteworthy for its description of what is
sometimes called “Abrahamic astronomy.”1 Chapter 3 of the Book
of Abraham, along with Facsimile 2, contains this astronomical portrait,
which is not always easy to understand. Scholars looking at the text in
chapter 3 have articulated at least three different models for interpreting
this feature.
The first model seeks to understand the astronomy in the Book of
Abraham through a scientific lens. Those who accept this paradigm have
offered arguments for how Abrahamic astronomy can be harmonized
with modern science.2 The second model works under the assumption
that the astronomical concepts presented in the Book of Abraham are
rooted in ancient cosmology. In particular, this model sees the Book of
1. For instance, Erich Robert Paul, Science, Religion, and Mormon Cosmology
(Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1992), 87, 100, 102–3, 121; Daniel C. Peterson,

with Jed Woodworth, Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling (New York: Alfred A. Knopf,
2005), 454.
2. Historically, this has proven to be the most popular model. See, for example,
Andrew Jenson, “Joseph Smith a True Prophet, III: Astronomy of Abraham,” Latter-day
Saints’ Millennial Star 53, no. 16 (April 20, 1891): 241–44; and J. E. Hickman, “Astronomy
Attests the Truth of the Book of Abraham,” Improvement Era 19, no. 7 (May 1916): 591–96.

Abraham as depicting a geocentric (earth-centered) view of the cosmos,
which differs from our modern scientific understanding that the sun is
at the center of our solar system.3 The third model argues for essentially
an inverse of the second model and puts forth a reading of the Book of
Abraham’s astronomy that places Kolob, not the earth, at the center of the
cosmos. This model argues that while the astronomy of the Book of Abraham may be ancient, the main focus should be on the spiritual truths that
can be gleaned from the text.4
Each of these models has its respective strengths and weaknesses.
For the purposes of this treatment (placing the Book of Abraham in
the ancient world), the second model that sees the Book of Abraham’s
astronomy as an ancient geocentric cosmos is worth paying close attention to. According to this model,
the astronomy in the Book of Abraham uses as its point of reference “the
earth upon which thou standest” (Abraham 3:3, 5–7). It mentions various heavenly bodies, such as “the stars” (Abraham 3:2), among which is
Kolob (Abraham 3:3–4). These provide a fixed backdrop for the heavens.
Among the stars are various bodies that move in relation to the fixed
backdrop, each of which is called a “planet” (Abraham 3:5, 8) or a “light”
(Abraham 3:5–7), though since the sun and moon and certain stars are
each also called a “planet,” we should not think of them as necessarily being what we call planets. Each of these planets is associated with
“its times and seasons in the revolutions thereof ” (Abraham 3:4). These
lights revolve around something, and that is the fixed reference point,
“the earth upon which thou standest” (Abraham 3:3, 5–7). The Book of
Abraham thus presents a geocentric astronomy, like almost all ancient
astronomies, including ancient Egyptian astronomy.5
Importantly, the Lord explicitly told Abraham: “I show these things
[the heavenly bodies described in Abraham 3] unto thee before ye go
into Egypt, that ye may declare all these words” (Abr. 3:15). Evidently
the astronomy revealed to Abraham was meant, in part, to take conceptions of the cosmos familiar to the ancient Egyptians and replace
them with a proper gospel understanding. “Abraham was to teach not

only astronomy but also gospel principles the Lord explained through
astronomic means.”6 This could explain why the Book of Abraham contains an apparently prescientific description of the cosmos rooted in the
ancient world. This could only be feasibly accomplished if Abraham
communicated to the Egyptians and likened the cosmos to gospel truths
in ways they understood.
While the Book of Abraham’s astronomy symbolically teaches
important truths about the plan of salvation,7 and while it is interesting
to explore how modern science might inform our understanding, the
cosmology in the text can also be grounded in the ancient world.

Shinehah, the Sun
One of the astronomical terms defined in the Book of Abraham is
Shinehah, which is said to be the sun (Abr. 3:13). Earlier in the
Book of Abraham, the “god of Shagreel” is identified as the sun as well
(Abr. 1:9). The context of these passages suggests that Shagreel is a West
Semitic name or word while Shinehah is an Egyptian name or word,
although this is not explicit in the text.1 We do not know how Joseph
Smith intended the word Shinehah to be pronounced; whether, for
instance, shine-hah or shi-ney-hah or some other way.2 However it is pronounced, contrary to the claim made by some of Joseph Smith’s critics,3
there is evidence that Shinehah is an authentic ancient Egyptian word.
1. The identity of this god is not certain, but there are a number of possibilities. See the
explorations in Hugh Nibley, An Approach to the Book of Abraham, ed. John Gee, The Collected Works of Hugh Nibley 18 (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book; Provo, Utah: Foundation for
Ancient Research and Mormon Studies, 2009), 416–17; Hugh Nibley and Michael D. Rhodes,

believes Shinehah and its companion word Olea (defined as “the moon” at Abr. 3:13) derive
from Joseph Smith’s work attempting to recover the “pure language” of Adam.

Shinehah, the Sun 139
Beginning around 2350 BC, “the walls of the inner chambers and corridors of ancient Egyptian pyramids were inscribed with a series of ritual
and magical spells” known today as the Pyramid Texts. “These inscriptions
constitute the oldest body of Egyptian religious writings” and were later
copied “on tombs, sarcophagi, coffins, canopic chests, papyri, stelae, and
other funerary monuments of nonroyal Egyptians.”4 Discovered in 1880
and translated into English for the first time in 1952,5 the Pyramid Texts
were intended to outline the “deceased’s relationship to two gods, Osiris
and the Sun,” and guide him or her through the afterlife as a glorified spirit.6
Among other things, the Pyramid Texts provided astronomical or
cosmological information meant to help guide the deceased on this
afterlife journey.7 “Since it was predicated on the Sun’s daily cycle of
death and rebirth, the deceased’s own afterlife was envisioned as a journey in company with the Sun.”8 The path of the sun through the sky from
east to west, known as the ecliptic, was envisioned in the Pyramid Texts
as a celestial canal or waterway that bisected the sky into northern and
southern hemispheres.9 Indeed, this canal or waterway was probably
seen as “the celestial counterpart of the Nile.”10 Inscriptions from the
Pyramid Texts overtly speak of the sun (or the solar barque) traveling
along this celestial waterway.11
There are two names given for this celestial canal or waterway (the
sun’s ecliptic) in the Pyramid Texts. The more common spelling is mrn-xA and is translated by Egyptologist James Allen as “Winding Canal.”12
A less common but still attested second name for this same “Winding
Canal” in the Pyramid Texts is spelled in a way that by Abraham’s time

may have been pronounced similar to shi-ne-hah (S-n-xA or S nxA).13
Although they alternate in the Pyramid Texts, the different spellings of
the name would have likely been seen as being synonymous,14 and so
Egyptologists today typically standardize the spelling to read all attestations of the name the more common way (mr-n-xA).15 Despite this, the
name survived into Abraham’s day in texts known today as the Coffin
Texts (which were, in part, something of a direct descendant of the Pyramid Texts) predominantly as S-n-xA (or S nxA).16

624 (§1759b), PT 697 (§2172c), PT 767 (§20). There is some question about the original
pronunciation of the first consonant in the name S-n-xA. The hieroglyph used to represent the sound sh (š) (compare Rainer Hannig, Ägyptisches Wörterbuch I: Altes Reich
und Erste Zwischenzeit [Mainz, Ger.: Verlag Philipp von Zabern, 2003], 1278–79) was
also used in Old Egyptian (the form of the Egyptian language the Pyramid Texts were
written in) to represent the sound x (X). Questions remain as to whether the glyph was
originally pronounced sh (š) or x (X). See the discussion in Antonio Loprieno, Ancient
Egyptian: A Linguistic Introduction (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 34;
James P. Allen, The Ancient Egyptian Language: An Historical Study (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013), 44–45; James P. Allen, A Grammar of the Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts, Volume 1: Unis (Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 2017), 25–26; and
James P. Allen, Ancient Egyptian Phonology (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,
2020), 68–69. By Abraham’s day, the glyph was being pronounced uniformly as sh (š),
so while the original pronunciation of this spelling of the name remains debated, the
way the word is rendered in the Book of Abraham with sh is entirely justifiable. Unfortunately, because the vocalization of ancient Egyptian is still largely educated guesswork,
especially when it comes to the vowels, at this point we can only give approximations
about how S-n-xA would have been pronounced in Abraham’s day. What matters most for
Shinehah in the Book of Abraham is that the consonants match S-n-xA/S nxA rather nicely.
On Middle Egyptian vocalization, see James P. Allen, Middle Egyptian: An Introduction
to the Language and Culture of Hieroglyphs, 3rd ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press, 2012), 18–21; and Allen, Ancient Egyptian Phonology.

A Hieroglyphic Dictionary of Egyptian Coffin Texts (Leiden, Neth.: Brill, 2000), 599, who
transliterates the glyphs as S nxA and renders the name as “Waterway of the Winding.”
The first attempt to compile and publish the Coffin Texts was undertaken by the French
scholar Pierre Lacau beginning in 1904. Adriaan de Buck published the first complete
Shinehah, the Sun 141
From this evidence it is clear that both S-n-xA and mr-n-xA are
attested as names for the sun’s ecliptic. The latter is more common in
the Old Kingdom (ca. 2686–2181 BC) but the former is more common
in the Middle Kingdom (ca. 2040–1782 BC) and thus in Abraham’s day.17
The spelling of the name as attested in the Coffin Texts from Abraham’s
day matches the spelling of Shinehah in the Book of Abraham fairly
closely. What’s more, the context in the Book of Abraham is significant
since Shinehah (the sun) is oriented in a tiered cosmos of graded celestial bodies (the moon, stars, and so forth) rotating around the earth at
faster or slower revolutions depending on their relative distance to the
earth (Abr. 3:4–9, 16–17).18
So while the Egyptian word for the sun itself is not the same as in the
Book of Abraham,19 one of the Egyptian words for the sun’s ecliptic
(the path of the sun through the sky) as attested in Abraham’s day is.20

(effectively, “one eternal round”). While this might be plausible etymologically, the main
drawback to this proposed origin for the word Shinehah is that it is hypothetical and
reconstructed, whereas S-n-xA/S nxA is attested. Nibley and Rhodes also rightly pick up
on the cosmological significance of the sun’s “motion relative to that of other heavenly
bodies” in Abraham 3:13.

Kolob, the Governing One
One of the more memorable contributions of the Book of Abraham is
its depiction of Kolob (Abr. 3:3–4, 9, 16; Facsimile 2, fig. 1). According to the Book of Abraham, Kolob is characterized by the following:
• It is a star or planet (Abr. 3:1–2, 8–9).1
• It is a “great [star]” and one of the “governing ones” (Abr. 3:3).
1. The Book of Abraham tends to conflate “star” with “planet,” leading some
Latter-day Saints to speak of Kolob as a planet or world. Compare, for instance, William Appleby, Journal, 5 May 1841, MS 1401, Church History Library; Brigham Young,

from the ancient Near East did not neatly distinguish the two categories as is done in

• It is “near unto [God]” or “nigh unto the throne of God” (Abr. 3:2–
3, 9–10).
• It was used to tell relative time (“one revolution [of Kolob] was
a day unto the Lord, after his manner of reckoning, it being one
thousand years according to the time appointed unto that whereon
thou [Abraham] standest” [Abr. 3:4]).
• It “signify[ed] the first creation, nearest to the celestial, or the residence of God. First in government, the last pertaining to the measurement of time. The measurement according to celestial time,
which celestial time signifies one day to a cubit” (Facsimile 2, fig. 1).
Latter-day Saints have long been interested in Kolob for its doctrinal and cosmological significance.2 The opening words to the beloved
hymn “If You Could Hie to Kolob,” written by William W. Phelps, were
of course inspired by Kolob in the Book of Abraham.3
In recent years, spurred on by promising discoveries, some Latterday Saint scholars have sought to situate Kolob in the ancient world.

Although there are still many uncertainties, a few points in favor of the
name and concept of Kolob being authentically ancient can be affirmed
with reasonable certainty.
First is the matter of the etymology of the name Kolob. One of the
more common proposals is that the name derives from the Semitic root
qlb,4 meaning “heart, center, middle,” and so forth, and is thus related
to the Semitic root qrb, meaning “to be near, close.”5 This explanation is
enticing because throughout the third chapter of the Book of Abraham,
Kolob is conceptually linked with the idea of being near God and his
celestial residence (vv. 2–3, 9–10, 16). It thus works well as a pun on the
name within the Book of Abraham itself:
• “the name of the great one is Kolob, because it is near unto me [that
is the Lord]” (v. 3, emphasis added).
• “until thou come nigh unto Kolob, which Kolob is after the reckoning of the Lord’s time; which Kolob is set nigh unto the throne of
God, to govern all those planets which belong to the same order as
that upon which thou standest” (v. 9, emphasis added).
• “therefore Kolob is the greatest of all the Kokaubeam [stars] that
thou hast seen, because it is nearest unto me” (v. 16, emphasis
added).
The drawback to this theory, however, is that qlb as a Semitic word for
“heart, center” is only attested in Semitic languages as far back as Arabic
(qalb; “heart, core”), which emerged considerably later than Abraham’s

time.6 However, some scholars believe that the Semitic qrb (and Arabic qalb) are ultimately derived from the reconstructed Afroasiatic root
*ḳlb/ḳrb,7 which has attested cognate descendants in Egyptian (qAb; “interior, midst”), Akkadian (qerbum; “inside”), and Hebrew (qereb; “inside,
middle”).8 The Egyptian example (qAb)9 is especially interesting, because
there is evidence that the Egyptian aleph /A/ in Abraham’s day was used
to render the liquid consonants /r/ and /l/ in Semitic languages.10 This
strengthens the etymology for Kolob proposed above and the likelihood
of genuine Semitic-Egyptian paronomasia in the text of the Book of
Abraham.
Another promising proposal is that Kolob derives from the Semitic
root klb, meaning “dog.”11 This theory has been circulating since at
least the early twentieth century, when a non–Latter-day Saint named
James E. Homans (writing under the pseudonym Robert C. Webb) postulated this idea in 1913.12 This, in turn, has prompted some to identify

Kolob with Sirius, the dog-star.13 This theory actually goes back as far
as the mid-nineteenth century, when William W. Phelps captured the
idea in an 1857 poem.14 Known as Sopdet in ancient Egypt (or Sothis
in Greek), Sirius held both mythological and calendrical significance to
the ancient Egyptians. Usually associated with the goddesses Isis and
Hathor, the star Sirius “had a special role because its heliacal rising coincided with the ideal Egyptian New Year day that was linked with the
onset of the Nile inundation.”15 Both Sirius and Kolob share a number of
overlapping characteristics, including the following:
• Both are associated with the throne of God.16
• Both are recognized as the “greatest” (probably meaning brightest)
of stars in earth’s night sky.17

Throne of God in the heavens is commonplace in the Bible (for example, Ps. 11:4; 103:19;
Matt. 5:34; 23:22; and Rev. 4:1–2, 5–6).

• Both are depicted as governing other stars.18
• Both are associated with creation.19
• Both are significant in measuring time.
While these convergences are compelling, the identification of Kolob
as Sirius faces some difficulties. For starters, most of Sirius’s features
just reviewed are attested in Egyptian sources from the Greco-Roman
Period, long after Abraham’s day (although it may be significant that this
is the time period of the Joseph Smith Papyri). The Egyptian word for
“dog” (iw) is also quite different from the Semitic word for the same.20
Furthermore, Ancient Mesopotamian astronomical texts do speak of a
star or constellation called Kalbu (Dog),21 but it is unclear if this Kalbu
was identified anciently with the constellation Canis Major (which contains Sirius) or another, such as Hercules.22 By the Greco-Roman period,
winter sky, Sirius is prominent as the principal star of the constellation Canis Major,
Latin for the Greater Dog.” Holberg, Sirius, 15.
18. As “the star which fixes and governs the periodic return of the year” (James Bonwick, Egyptian Belief and Modern Thought [London: C. Kegan Paul, 1878], 113) and the
annual inundation of the Nile, Sirius (specifically its godly manifestation as Hathor/Isis)
bore the epithets “Lady of the beginning of the year, Sothis, Mistress of the stars” (nbt tp

of Lugalanda and Urkagina,” Journal of the American Oriental Society 31, no. 3 [1911]:

Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 1996], 55; and Black, George, Postgate, A Concise Dictionary of

leave the identification of Kalbu unspecified. In Syriac, kelb does refer to Sirius, as it does
in Arabic (al-kalb al-akbar, “the great dog”), although both languages postdate Abraham
148 BYU Studies Quarterly
there is evidence that Sirius (Isis-Sothis) was “represented as a large
dog,”23 and it is possible that this representation predates Abraham’s
day, although this point is disputed among Egyptologists.24 Additionally,
scholars who study ancient astronomical texts emphasize that “the identifications between the ancient names and modern names [for stars and
constellations] are only approximate and are meant to serve as an aid
to the modern reader, rather than to imply exact equivalence between
ancient and modern constellations.”25 With this amount of lingering
uncertainty, the identification of Kolob with Sirius should therefore be
accepted cautiously.
Conceptually, the way Kolob is depicted in the Book of Abraham
indicates some awareness (and attempted subversion) of ancient Egyptian cosmology.
The ancient Egyptians associated the idea of encircling something
(whether in the sky or on earth) with controlling or governing it, and
the same terms are used for both. Thus, the Book of Abraham notes that
“there shall be the reckoning of the time of one planet above another,
until thou come nigh unto Kolob, . . . which Kolob is set nigh unto the
throne of God, to govern all those planets which belong to the same order
as that upon which thou standest” (Abraham 3:9; emphasis added). The
Egyptians had a similar notion, in which the sun (Re) was not only a god
but the head of all the gods and ruled over everything that he encircled.
Abraham’s astronomy sets the sun, “that which is to rule the day” (Abraham 3:5), as greater than the moon but less than Kolob, which governs
the sun (Abraham 3:9). Thus, in the astronomy of the Book of Abraham,
Kolob, which is the nearest star to God (Abraham 3:16; see also [3:]3,
9), revolves around and thus encircles or controls the sun, which is the
head of the Egyptian pantheon.26
considerably, and so it is uncertain if this identification extends as far back as the Middle
Bronze Age. R. Payne Smith, A Compendious Syriac Dictionary (Oxford: Clarendon, 1903),

are some very tantalizing pieces of evidence that, when brought together,
reinforce the overall plausible antiquity of this astronomical concept
unique to the Book of Abraham.

The Divine Council
One thing that differentiates the Book of Abraham’s account of the
Creation from the biblical account in Genesis is that the Book of
Abraham mentions plural Gods as the agents carrying out the Creation.
“And then the Lord said: Let us go down. And they went down at the
beginning, and they, that is the Gods, organized and formed the heavens
and the earth” (Abr. 4:1). These Gods are mentioned thirty-two times in
Abraham 4 and sixteen times in Abraham 5. Significantly, these Gods
are said to have taken “counsel” among themselves during the Creation
(Abr. 4:26; 5:2–3, 5).
This language of the Gods taking counsel among themselves in Abraham 4–5 appears to be a natural continuation of the description of the
premortal council in heaven described in Abraham 3:22–28.1 One of
“rulers” in the premortal council who was “like unto God” is depicted
as saying, “We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take
of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;
and we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them” (vv. 23–25). In this manner the council of Gods in Abraham 3 counseled with each other during
the Creation in Abraham 4–5.
1. It should be noted that unlike the modern versification of the Book of Abraham
provided by James E. Talmage starting in the 1902 edition of the Pearl of Great Price, the
versification of the Book of Abraham provided in the Times and Seasons under Joseph
Smith’s supervision does not separate chapters 3 and 4 of the Book of Abraham, so the
premortal council scene in Abraham 3 reads as one unbroken, continuous narrative into
the Creation starting in Abraham 4. Indeed, what is today Abraham 3:27–4:2 was just
one verse as published by Joseph Smith. “The Book of Abraham,” Times and Seasons 3,
no. 10 (March 15, 1842): 720.
The Divine Council 151
After the lifetime of Joseph Smith, archaeologists working in Egypt,
Syria-Palestine, and Mesopotamia uncovered scores of texts written on
papyrus, stone, and clay tablets. As these texts were translated, scholars
were surprised to discover creation myths that in many ways paralleled
the biblical Creation account while differing in other significant ways.2
One way in which these creation myths were different from the Creation account in Genesis was the clear, stark portrayal of what came to
be widely called the divine or heavenly council. In many of these myths,
a group or family of gods or divinities work together in fashioning the
components of the cosmos.3 Other times, the gods engage in divine
battle over control of the cosmos.4 Whatever the specific case, almost
universally these myths described multiple deities serving different roles
or functions in the process of Creation.
With this extrabiblical material in mind, and with the discovery of
superior manuscripts such as the Dead Sea Scrolls that provided better
readings of certain biblical passages,5 scholars returned to the Hebrew
Bible and reevaluated passages that appeared to acknowledge the presence of a divine plurality. Over time, a consensus has been reached that
the Bible does indeed portray a multiplicity of gods, even if there remains
individual scholarly disagreement over some of the finer details.6

In contrast to typical Jewish and Christian belief in Joseph Smith’s
day, the Book of Abraham frankly depicts a plurality of Gods and even
uses specific language (“took counsel among themselves,” Abr. 4:26) that
invokes the presence of what is now widely recognized by scholars as the
unquestionably ancient concept of the divine council. This divine council as depicted in the Book of Abraham is composed of, at least,
• “intelligences” and “noble and great ones” (Abr. 3:22);
• “God” (v. 23);
• “one . . . that was like unto God” (v. 24), who was “like unto the Son
of Man” (v. 27); and
• “another” who was “second” to the one who was “like unto God”
(v. 27).
According to the Book of Abraham, then, God the Father did indeed
work with a council, of which Jesus Christ and other “noble and great”
premortal intelligences, “souls,” or “spirits” (vv. 22–23) were members.
The polytheistic divine councils of the ancient Near East might well be
echoes of the conception of the divine council portrayed in the Book
of Abraham, or vice versa. To be sure, while there are striking similarities between the Book of Abraham and other ancient texts that feature
a divine council, there are also notable differences. What is important
for the Book of Abraham is that the text broadly (and even in some
instances, specifically) shares a similar ancient conception of a heavenly
hierarchy or council of divine beings. Besides the examples already provided in print,7 take additionally the grave stela of Tjetji, an important

“the great god” (nTr aA) and is welcomed into the “divine council” (DADAtnTr). This divine council is said to be a tribunal of “great ones” (wrw, with
“seated god” determinative) who extend their arms to Tjetji when he is
brought on board the sacred barque of Osiris (dit n.f awy m nSmt), thus
assuring his divinization in the afterlife.8
While it is true that Joseph Smith learned from his Hebrew studies that the word for God (Elohim) in the Old Testament is technically
a masculine plural noun,9 it does not seem likely that he would have
learned about the divine council from his Hebrew teacher, Joshua Seixas,
since the two seemed to strongly disagree on the implications this fact
held for the biblical view of God.10 In any case, with the exception of the
Bible, the surviving ancient texts that overtly depict the divine council
were unknown in the Prophet’s day.

the former was an Orthodox Jew who later “adopted the basic tenets of Unitarian [Christian] belief.” As such, “it is highly doubtful that [he] would have advanced a pantheistic

While the theological implications of the divine council remain to
be fully explored and articulated,11 what can be said with a fair degree
of reasonableness is that the Book of Abraham’s depiction of the divine
council shares features present in other ancient Near Eastern texts, some
of which date to Abraham’s day. This reinforces belief that the Book of
Abraham is authentically ancient.

“[An] everlasting covenant was made between three personages before the organizations
of the earth, and relates to their dispensation of things to men on the earth. These personages, according to Abraham’s record, are called: God the first, the Creator; God the
second, the Redeemer, and God the third, the witness or Testator.” “Discourse, circa

On another occasion, the Prophet taught, “I have always declared God to be a distinct
personage, Jesus Christ a separate and distinct personage from God the Father, [and] the
Holy Ghost a distinct personage and a Spirit. These three constitute three distinct personages and three Gods.” “Discourse, 16 June 1844–A, as Reported by Thomas Bullock,”

clarified this subject with additional teachings.

The Foreordination of Abraham
One of the most important doctrinal teachings in the Book of Abraham is that of the premortal existence of humankind and the foreordination of many “noble and great ones” to be God’s “rulers” (Abr.
3:22–28). Abraham himself was singled out as one who was divinely
preordained to a great mission. “Now the Lord had shown unto me,
Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was;
and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones; and
God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of
them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those
that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me:
Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born”
(vv. 22–23).1
1. The text of the Book of Abraham does not seem to specify how or in what capacity
these “noble and great” souls in the premortal council were to be “rulers.” Some Latterday Saints have interpreted this to be referring to those God chose and preordained to
be spiritual and secular leaders on earth (for example, Seymour B. Young, in Seventyfourth Semi-annual Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints [Salt Lake
City: Deseret News, 1903], 60.) Others have understood these “rulers” to be humans on
earth who exhibit exemplary attributes that make them outstanding among humanity
(for example, Orson F. Whitney, “The Fall and the Redemption,” Improvement Era 24,
no. 5 [March 1921]: 375). Others interpret the passage to be referring to the gods in the
divine council (for example, Blake Ostler, Exploring Mormon Thought: Of God and Gods
[Salt Lake City: Greg Kofford Books, 2008], 26–29). Another doctrinal interpretation
or application of these verses might be that these “rulers” are those who become “kings
and priests unto God” through the process of exaltation (Rev. 1:6; 5:10). As Joseph Smith
taught in his April 7, 1844, discourse known today as the King Follett Discourse, “You
have got to learn how to be a god yourself in order to save you[r]self—to be priests &
Kings as all Gods has done—by going from a small degree to another from exaltation
to ex[altation]—till they are able to sit in glory as doth those who sit enthroned.” “Discourse, 7 April 1844, as Reported by William Clayton,” 14, Joseph Smith Papers, accessed

Since the Book of Abraham so clearly teaches the idea of a premortal existence and the divine foreordination of rulers, the question might
reasonably be asked whether these teachings find a plausible context in
the ancient Near East. In fact, scholars recognize that Near Eastern
peoples believed in the divine foreordination of their kings (and in the
case of the ancient Israelites, some of their prophets).2 As one scholar
put it, “Divine election—the academic designation for the choosing
of people by deity for position and opportunity in mortal life—is a
claim that is well attested in ancient Near Eastern texts, including the
Hebrew Bible.”3
For example, perhaps the best-known biblical passage that speaks of
the divine foreordination and election of a prophet appears in the opening chapter of the book of Jeremiah. “Before I formed thee in the belly
I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified
thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations” (Jer. 1:5).4 Outside
of the Bible, in a prologue to his famous collection of laws, the ancient
Babylonian king Hammurabi (ca. 1810–1750 BC) depicted himself as
being foreordained by the gods to rule:
When the august God Anu . . . and the god Enlil, lord of heaven and
earth, who determines the destinies of the land, allotted supreme power
over all the peoples to the god Marduk[,] . . . [a]t that time, the gods Anu
and Enlil, for the enhancement of the well-being of the people, named
me by my name: Hammurabi, the pious prince, who venerates the gods,
to make justice prevail in the land, to abolish the wicked and the evil, to
prevent the strong from oppressing the weak, to rise like the sun-god
Shamash over all mankind, to illuminate the land.5
The ancient Egyptians of Abraham’s day likewise believed their
kings were divinely pre-elected to be rulers. One Egyptian text from

The Foreordination of Abraham 157
Abraham’s time says of the pharaoh Senwosret I (ca. 1950–1900 BC):
“Men and women surpass exultation in him, now that he is king. He took
possession [of kingship] in the egg; his face was toward it from before
he was born. Those born with him are multiple, but he is a unique one
of the god’s giving.”6 Additional texts from Abraham’s lifetime and many
centuries afterward point to this concept being both prevalent and longlasting in Egyptian thought.7
Some ancient Egyptian monarchs even went so far as to claim
that they were literal divine offspring. At her mortuary temple at Deir
el-Bahri, for example, the queen Hatshepsut, who reigned circa 1473–
1458 BC, commissioned a series of reliefs depicting herself as the literal
daughter of the god Amun-Re who could, accordingly, claim a divine
birthright to rule Egypt. The reliefs begin with a depiction of what Egyptologists call a “council of the gods,”8 where, in the midst of other important deities, Amun-Re foretells Hatshepsut’s reign, followed by scenes of
her divine conception, birth, and ascendency to the throne.9
Abraham appears to have not held any kingly titles in mortality yet was
designated a “noble and great one” who was foreordained to be a “ruler”
(Abr. 3:22–23). This must certainly have been true at least in a priesthood authority sense, and unlike the counterfeit priesthood authority of
pharaoh (Abr. 1:25–28), Abraham’s foreordination to the priesthood was
legitimate and ratified through a covenant with God (Abr. 2:6–11).10 Thus,

by drawing attention to his foreordained status, Abraham may have been
demonstrating how the power and divine authority usually associated
with earthly kings was more legitimately and eternally endowed upon
God’s preordained earthly servants.
The Book of Abraham’s teachings about foreordination and divine
election are therefore important for the eternal truths they preserve and
how they ground the text in a plausible ancient context.

The Son of Man
I
n the Book of Abraham’s divine-council scene, God proposes to send
a redemptive emissary to ensure that those premortal intelligences
or spirits who entered their second estate and faithfully did “all things
whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them” would have “glory
added upon their heads for ever and ever” (Abr. 3:25–26). When the
Lord asked whom he should send to be this emissary, “one answered like
unto the Son of Man: Here am I, send me. And another answered and
said: Here am I, send me. And the Lord said: I will send the first” (v. 27).
This “first” personage to answer the Lord’s call for a mortal representative of his plan of redemption is identified in other books of scripture
as Jesus Christ (Moses 4:1–2; Ether 3:14).1 Here, however, the premortal
Jesus is not explicitly named but rather is given the title “one . . . like unto
the Son of Man.”
The title “Son of Man” has some nuanced difference depending on
the context of its usage.2 In biblical Hebrew, the phrase “son of man”
(ben ʾadam) connotes simply “mortal, human.”3 In the book of Ezekiel,
for example, it is used by God when addressing the prophet (for example
1. Note, however, that Moses 4:1–2 depicts Lucifer as being the first to present himself. How to reconcile this with Abraham 3:27, if at all possible, remains elusive. For a
general perspective, see Andrew C. Skinner, “The Premortal Godhood of Christ: A Restoration Perspective,” in Jesus Christ: Son of God, Savior, ed. Paul H. Peterson, Gary L.

Ezek. 2:1, 3, 6, 8; 3:1, 3, 10; 4:1, 16; 5:1; 6:2). In apocalyptic biblical works,
most notably the book of Daniel (7:13–14), the Son of Man (Aramaic: bar
ʾenash), or, more technically, a figure like (kĕ) a son of man, is depicted
as a sort of eschatological figure who assumes rulership over the earth
at the end of days. “The figure in this passage [Dan. 7:13–14] is one like
a son of man, meaning a divine figure who looked like a human. He
will have authority and will be worshipped by all people. Note also the
language tying this figure to the Davidic kingship ideal, that he will be a
king whose kingdom will be everlasting.”4
This divine figure was developed in apocalyptic Jewish works from
the time of Jesus (such as the book of 1 Enoch) into “a divine messianic
figure” and “a premortal being who was closely associated with God,
would have dominion over all earthly kingdoms, would be worshipped
by all people, would judge the wicked and overthrow his enemies, would
establish an everlasting kingdom, and would be the ‘Messiah.’”5 Believed
by his disciples to be this very eschatological figure,6 Jesus is identified as
the Son of Man throughout the canonical Gospels and other New Testament writings (compare Matt. 27:64; Rev. 1:13).
In Latter-day Saint understanding, the title Son of Man takes on
additional significance. One of the Adamic names for God the Father is
revealed in Restoration scripture to be “Man of Holiness” (Moses 6:57;
7:35). Apostles James E. Talmage and Bruce R. McConkie have both
linked Jesus’s identity as the Son of Man with his divine parentage as
the firstborn of this Man of Holiness (compare D&C 78:20; 93:21–22;
95:17).7 As Elder Talmage taught, “The word of revelation, given in this
day, makes plain the meaning as to who was the one and only supremely

glorified Man, whom Christ knew—God, the Eternal Father, the Father
of the spirit of Jesus, and literally, the Father of His body. Therefore the
title ‘The Son of Man’ is an appellation of glory, authority and power
among all sons of men. The Son of Man is the Only Begotten of the one
and only supremely glorified Man at that time.”8
That the Book of Abraham says Jesus was like unto the Son of Man,
rather than being the Son of Man, might reflect the influence of the
King James Version of the Bible on Joseph Smith’s translation, since that
wording appears in Daniel 7:13 and Revelation 1:13. Alternatively, the
comparative may have been used because Daniel 7, Revelation 1, and
Abraham 3 are all visions, and the visionary image was like unto the
actual Son of Man—that is, a sort of visionary or heavenly facsimile of
the real thing.9
Whatever the case, the identity of the premortal Jesus as “one like
unto the Son of Man” in the Book of Abraham might be understood
simultaneously in the contexts discussed above. He is the firstborn of
the Man of Holiness, the one who condescended to become a mortal
“son of man” (compare 1 Ne. 11:14–36), and the foreordained Messiah.10
8. Talmage, “Son of Man,” 139.
9. An intriguing alternative possibility is that the Book of Abraham’s language in
this verse (“one answered like unto the Son of Man”) reflects an underlying Egyptianism—what is called by grammarians the “m of predication.” In the Egyptian language of
Abraham’s day, the preposition m (“in, inside,” “by means of, with,” “being, namely,”
“of, with,” and so forth) could be used in an adverbial comment to indicate that someone
or something serves in a certain capacity. This common usage of the adverbial predicate in Middle Egyptian acts to distinguish people and things by their function rather
than by their intrinsic essence or nature. The simple examples used by grammarians are
sentences like *iw=k m sA=i (“you are [like or as] a son to me”) and iw=k m sS (“you are
[acting as] a scribe”). See James E. Hoch, Middle Egyptian Grammar (Mississauga, Can.:
Benben Publications, 1997), §24; compare James P. Allen, Middle Egyptian: An Introduction to the Language and Culture of Hieroglyphs, 3rd ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), §10.6; and Alan Gardiner, Egyptian Grammar, 3rd rev. ed. (Oxford:
Griffith Institute, 1957), §38. If we pursue this line of thinking, then the Book of Abraham’s statement that “the first” was “like unto the Son of Man” would indicate that the
premortal Jesus was answering the call to act or serve in the capacity of the “Son of Man”
(that is, the redemptive eschatological figure prepared in the premortal council to effect
the Father’s plan).

The Fall of Lucifer
Similar to what is depicted in other books of Latter-day Saint scripture
(for example Moses 4:1–4), the Book of Abraham’s depiction of the
premortal council includes a brief mention of the fall of Lucifer. As readers encounter at the end of chapter 3 of the Book of Abraham, Lucifer’s
fall from the divine council was an act of rebellion because he was not
selected to carry out God’s plan of salvation.
And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said
unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there,
and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon
these may dwell; and we will prove them herewith, to see if they will
do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them; and
they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they who keep
not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with
those who keep their first estate; and they who keep their second estate
shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever. And the Lord
said: Whom shall I send? And one answered like unto the Son of Man:
Here am I, send me. And another answered and said: Here am I, send
me. And the Lord said: I will send the first. And the second was angry,
and kept not his first estate; and, at that day, many followed after him.
(Abr. 3:24–28)
While later biblical and extrabiblical writings from the first millennium BC contain reworked allusions to pervasive Near Eastern myths
about the fall of rebellious deities or angels (for example, Gen. 6:1–4; Isa.
14; Job 38; Ps. 82; Ezek. 28:1–10; 28:11–19; and Dan. 11–12),1 a fair question
1. On this topic, consult Hugh Rowland Page Jr., The Myth of Cosmic Rebellion:
A Study of Its Reflexes in Ugaritic and Biblical Literature (Leiden, Neth.: Brill, 1996);
R. Mark Shipp, Of Dead Kings and Dirges: Myth and Meaning in Isaiah 14:4b–21 (Atlanta:
164 BYU Studies Quarterly
to ask is whether this mythic archetype is attested in Near Eastern literature from Abraham’s day. In fact, there does appear to be evidence for
elements of this mythic concept in the literature of earlier Near Eastern
cultures.
Biblical scholar Mark Smith has recently drawn attention to the
“basic idea” underlying the myth of the “conflict between competing deities in the divine realm” being present in texts from the Middle and Late
Bronze Age sites of Mari and Ugarit. “These cases of divine conflict are
set in the divine council that meets in heaven; they end in the demotion or expulsion of the defeated deity.”2 In the Mari corpus is a letter
from Šamaš-naṣir, the governor of the city of Terqa, to Zimri-Lim, the
king of Mari from circa 1775 to 1760 BC.3 In this text, Šamaš-naṣir “gives
account of a vision concerning a heavenly verdict” by the god Dagan,
the chief deity of Mari, against other deities, including the god Tišpak
of the city Ešnunna. “This is done in the presence of other gods” in the
divine council and “corresponds to Zimri-Lim’s hoped-for victory over
King Ibalpiel II of Ešnunna, whose god [Tišpak]—and, through him,
the king himself—is threatened with” destruction.4 As the relevant section of the text reads, “‘[Now, let them c]all [Tišpak before me] and I
will pass judgment.’ So they called on Tišpak for me, and Dagan said to
Tišpak as follows: ‘From Šinaḫ (?) you have ruled the land. Now your day
has passed. You will confront your day like [the city] Ekallatum.’”5
As scholars recognize, this text clearly depicts a divine-council scene
where “a denial of the right of [another deity] to rule” is issued by the
edict of a superior deity.6 As such, it provides broad parallel with and
precedent to later biblical texts that depict the fall of rebellious divinities,7
as well as the Book of Abraham.

The Fall of Lucifer 165
Turning to the material from Ugarit, the Late Bronze Age text known
as the Baal Cycle depicts “cases of divine conflict [which] are set in the
divine council that meets in heaven; they end in the demotion or expulsion of the defeated deity.”8 One such scene from the Baal Cycle (KTU
1.2 I 19–48) narrates how the god Baal defiantly rebuked the messenger
gods of his rival, the deity Yamm, after they brought the divine council a message demanding surrender. The cycle ends with Baal defeating
Yamm and claiming kingship in the divine council (KTU 1.2 IV 30–41).9
That the Ugaritic Baal Cycle provides clear underlying mythic and literary precedent for later biblical iterations of this type-scene is widely
recognized by scholars.10
The mythic tales of Illuyanka and Kumarbi from ancient Anatolia
might also provide additional parallels to the rebellion of Lucifer in the
Book of Abraham.11 In the Illuyanka tales, which date to the Old Hittite period (ca. 1750–1500 BC), the chief deity of the people of Hatti, a
storm god, is “defeat[ed] and incapacitat[ed] . . . by an evil and powerful
reptile. . . . In both versions of the myth, the Storm God needs the help
of a mortal and a trick in order to regain supremacy over the serpent.”12
In the second version of the myth, the storm god battles and ultimately
prevails over the serpent at “an unspecified sea.”13
Finally, in the Hurrian Kumarbi Cycle (ca. 1400–1200 BC), “the central theme . . . is the competition between [the gods] Kumarbi and Tessub
for kingship over the gods.”14 This mythic cycle depicts how Kumarbi
“attempt[ed] . . . to supplant Tessub as king of the gods” through stratagem. This included one attempt where Kumarbi raised up his son Ullikummi “to destroy . . . the city of Tessub, and to dethrone Tessub” himself.
Tessub, however, concocts his own plan for defeating Ullikummi with
the help of members of the divine council, which he eventually does.15

There are very clear differences between these texts and the Book
of Abraham. For instance, the mythological texts from Ugarit and elsewhere just reviewed appear to be largely about competing deities who are
associated with the agricultural cycle or are represented as chthonic and
sky deities in competition. These elements are missing from the Book of
Abraham’s depiction. While we should be cautious not to suggest that
the Book of Abraham is directly drawing from these texts, or vice versa,
important parallels nevertheless do remain which are indicative of a general shared cultural and religious backdrop. The common elements in
these ancient Near Eastern and Anatolian myths and the Book of Abraham include the divine council as the setting, the involvement of multiple divinities or gods, some kind of attempt to supplant or overthrow the
chief deity of the council in an overt act of rebellion or defiance,16 and
the ultimate humiliation or downfall of the rebellious character.
From this and other evidence,17 “several striking affinities with
Semitic traditions are immediately available” in the Book of Abraham.
As seen above, “the council scene in particular is consistent with a standard motif in Mesopotamian and Ugaritic literature, wherein a divine
assembly convenes to consider a problem and a series of proposals is
offered.”18 This in turn reinforces the overall sense of antiquity and historical believability of the book.
16. The Book of Abraham does not make this point as explicitly as other Restoration scripture, such as the book of Moses, which depicts Satan as seeking “to destroy the
agency of man, which . . . the Lord God, had given him,” and also demanding “that [God]
should give unto him [his] own power.” This Satan does by proclaiming, “Behold, here
am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be
lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor” (Moses 4:1, 3). Nevertheless,
the implication that Satan is actively rebelling against God in the Book of Abraham can
be seen in his being described as “angry” at God’s decision to choose the one “like unto
the Son of Man.” Additionally, that “many followed after [Satan]” (Abr. 3:27–28) also
suggests a collective act of rebellion.

Creation from Chaos
Traditional Christianity teaches that God created the universe ex
nihilo, or “out of nothing.” As explained by one scholar, “the most
widely accepted theistic explanation of initial creation is the theory that
God created the universe from absolutely nothing. . . . Most major theologians in Christian history—for example, Irenaeus, Augustine, Catherine of Sienna, Thomas Aquinas, Martin Luther, John Calvin, John
Wesley, Karl Barth, and Paul Tilich—believed that God initially created
the universe from absolutely nothing. . . . Many influential Christians
throughout history have affirmed the theory.”1
By contrast, Joseph Smith taught that God created the universe ex
materia, or out of preexisting matter. “The learned men who are preaching
salvation say, that God created the heavens and the earth out of nothing,” the Prophet acknowledged in a sermon on April 7, 1844. However,
he maintained, the word bārā in Genesis 1:1 actually “means to organize”
in the similar sense that “a man would organize a ship.” Accordingly, the
Prophet reasoned that “God had materials to organize the world out of
chaos; chaotic matter, which is element, and in which dwells all the glory.”2

Creation from Chaos 169
This teaching is also found in the Book of Abraham,3 and the Prophet’s
later teachings about Creation may well indeed have been influenced
by his translation of Abraham’s record and his study of Hebrew related
thereto (although without the ability to check against an original Abrahamic manuscript, we should be careful not to assume too much about the
nature of the Hebrew terminology in the text).4
According to the Book of Abraham, there was one in the premortal
council “like unto God,” who proclaimed: “We will go down, for there
is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an
earth whereon these may dwell” (Abr. 3:24).5 In the next chapter, the text
says that the Gods (the members of the heavenly council) “organized
and formed the heavens and the earth” as opposed to creating them
(Abr. 4:1).6 The verbs organize and form are used throughout the Book
of Abraham’s Creation account instead of create, clearly indicating some
kind of divine activity or fashioning of material as opposed to creating
all matter ex nihilo.
Scholars now recognize that the ancient cultures of Egypt, SyriaCanaan, and Mesopotamia did not seem to countenance ideas of creation ex nihilo but rather envisioned creation as the emergence of an
ordered cosmos out of preexisting chaos. This preordered chaos is often
personified as a primordial cosmic ocean or as a primeval cosmic combat
himself had materials to org[anize] the world out of chaos which is Element & in which
dwells all the glory.”

of Abraham,” Journal of the Book of Mormon and Other Restoration Scripture 22, no. 2
(2013): 28–39.
4. Joseph Smith’s study of Hebrew appears very likely to have influenced his translation of the Book of Abraham, including the decision to render the verbs of activity in the
text’s Creation account as organize and form. The lexicon utilized by Joseph as he studied Hebrew in Kirtland defines the verb bārā as “to form, make, create,” although not
“organize.” Josiah W. Gibbs, Manual Hebrew and English Lexicon (New Haven, Conn.:
Hezekiah Howe, 1832), 36. As recognized by one scholar, however, it is “doubtful” that
Joseph got his teaching of creation ex materia from his study of Hebrew alone. Louis C.
Zucker, “Joseph Smith as a Student of Hebrew,” Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought
3, no. 2 (Summer 1968): 52. The extent to which Joseph’s study of Hebrew influenced his
later teachings and translations thus remains open to discussion. For a recent perspective, see Matthew J. Grey, “‘The Word of the Lord in the Original’: Joseph Smith’s Study
of Hebrew in Kirtland,” in Approaching Antiquity: Joseph Smith and the Ancient World,

between gods in ancient Near Eastern creation myths.7 For instance, in
ancient Egyptian mythology, the earth first emerged as a primeval hillock, springing out of a preexisting, chaotic, and unorganized primordial
ocean called Nun.8 In the Mesopotamian myth known as Enuma Elish
(from the opening lines of the text meaning “when on high” in ancient
Akkadian), the evil goddess Tiamat is defeated in battle by the god Marduk, and her body is split in half to form the cosmos.9
Although not obvious from reading the King James translation, Creation is similarly imagined in the Bible as order emerging from a state
of disorder. As the biblical scholar Marc Zvi Brettler has noted, “The
opposite of structure is chaos, and it is thus appropriate that [Genesis]
1:1–2 describe primeval chaos—a world that is ‘unformed and void,’ containing darkness and a mysterious wind. This story does not describe
creation out of nothing (Latin: creatio ex nihilo). Primeval stuff already
exists in verses 1–2, and the text shows no concern for how it originated.
Rather, it is a[n account] about how God alone structured primordial
matter into a highly organized world.”10

This may hold significance for the Book of Abraham’s depiction of
the Gods “ordering” the elements of the cosmos, which “obey” when so
commanded (Abr. 4:7, 9–12, 18, 21, 25). This language ultimately “conjures [imagery] typical of the Near Eastern creation mythology . . . of
kingly dominion establishing order over a previously chaotic cosmos.”11
So while the Book of Abraham’s teachings about Creation might be out
of place in the typical Christian thinking of Joseph Smith’s day, they are
not out of place in the world of the ancient Near East.

Ancient Near Eastern Creation Myths
The Book of Abraham’s Creation account (Abr. 4–5) shares an obvious
relationship with the biblical Creation account in Genesis (Gen. 1–2).
However, it also shares common features with creation myths from
ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia.
Turning to the Egyptian evidence, “the order of the creation process
in the Book of Abraham is similar to that provided in Coffin Text 80,
a text that appears in copies dating from about two hundred years before
Abraham down to Abraham’s time, and is the only lengthy creation text
we know of from that time.”1 This text begins with a depiction of a primordial chaos (“the Abyss, in darkness and in gloom”2), which, like
that in the Book of Abraham, clearly rules out a depiction of creation
ex nihilo, or “out of nothing.” In this account,
the creator was “one who lit up the sky after the darkness.” The creator
discusses the time when “I could not find a place to stand or to sit, before
Heliopolis was founded so that I could be in it, before reeds were tied on
which I could sit, before I made heaven so that it could be over my head
. . . before the divine council existed.” Then the creator “begat the eldest
of his spirits . . . when he separated earth from heaven,” and then he
“made grain.” Various animals are given life: falcons, jackals, pigs, hippopotami, men, crocodiles, and fish “according to the command of ” the
creator “so that I may lead them to live with my mouth, which is life in
their nostrils. I guided my breath into their throats.” The account has a

number of other details, but it discusses similar topics in a similar order
to the Book of Abraham.3
Considering that Abraham was directed to declare his teachings
about astronomy and creation to the Egyptians (Abr. 3:15), it is favorable for the Book of Abraham’s historicity that “the accounts are close
enough for ancient Egyptians to find something in the Book of Abraham
that would provide familiar echoes to their own accounts.”4
Additionally, “there are . . . parallels between the Book of Abraham
and contemporary Mesopotamian creation accounts,” although these
parallels are more general and in some cases only cursory.5 One such
account, the myth of the gods Enki and Ninmah, “refers to the ‘day when
heaven [was separated] from earth,’ and it follows with a discussion
of the creation of humans by mixing the blood of a God with the clay
from which humans were made. . . . [It also depicts] the separation of
heaven and earth before the making of mortals.”6 This text also directly
mentions the primeval chaos, aligning with the Book of Abraham in
rejecting creation ex nihilo.7 Other Mesopotamian creation myths also
portray the separation of heaven and earth and the creation of humans
in the same general order as the Book of Abraham, although the purposes behind the creation of humans are different in these accounts.8
Another interesting similarity between the Book of Abraham’s Creation account and ancient Mesopotamian creation myths is that “the
creation of man is connected with the sacrifice of a god” in these texts.9
This is seen in one myth where gods are slaughtered, and from their

8. Gee, Introduction to the Book of Abraham, 134. “Though the explicit purpose of life
between the two accounts is similar, for the Babylonians, the purpose of life was to do heavy
labor for the benefit of the gods so that the gods would no longer have to work. In the Book
of Abraham, life is a test to ‘prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever
the Lord their God shall command them’ (Abraham 3:25). Such a test may include serving
God or their fellowman and might involve hard work, but it may also involve many other
things—and it involves more than simply being a slave to take over menial tasks. The Book
of Abraham promises rewards for obedience which are missing from the Babylonian text.”

blood humankind is fashioned,10 as well as in the myth of Atrahasis, in
which humans are created from the flesh and blood of the sacrificed god
Weila mixed with clay.11
In the Book of Abraham this [connection with sacrifice] is mentioned
obliquely: “The Lord said: Whom shall I send? And one answered like
unto the Son of Man: Here am I, send me. And another answered and
said: Here am I, send me. And the Lord said: I will send the first” (Abraham 3:27). Latter-day Saints connect this with other accounts of the preexistence to equate the one “like unto the Son of Man” with the premortal
Jesus and the other with Lucifer (see Moses 4:1–4) and that the creation
of man was dependent on the Son of God being willing to offer himself
as an atonement for humans. The parallel, however, is with Latter-day
Saint interpretation of the Book of Abraham and not the text of the Book
of Abraham as we currently have it. That might be different if we had the
full Book of Abraham.12
These parallels between the Book of Abraham’s Creation account and
ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian myths serve nicely in situating the
text in a plausible ancient Near Eastern context in Abraham’s day.

By His Own Hand upon Papyrus
I
n the current (2013) edition of the Pearl of Great Price, the Book
of Abraham is prefaced with this explanatory head: “A Translation of
some ancient Records that have fallen into our hands from the catacombs of Egypt. The writings of Abraham while he was in Egypt, called
the Book of Abraham, written by his own hand, upon papyrus.”1 This
title is based on the March 1, 1842, printing of the Book of Abraham
in the Times and Seasons, with some alteration. As first published,
the statement read, “A  TRANSLATION Of some ancient Records that
have fallen into our hands, from the Catecombs of Egypt, purporting
to be the writings of Abraham, while he was in Egypt, called the Book
of Abraham, written by his own hand, upon papyrus.”2 A look at the
Kirtland-era manuscript evidence for the Book of Abraham reveals a
similar phrase: “Translation of the Book of Abraham written by his own
hand upon papyrus and found in the CataCombs of Egypts.”3

Some have wondered how the papyrus acquired by Joseph Smith
could have possibly been written by Abraham’s “own hand” when it
dates to circa 300 BC, many centuries after Abraham’s lifetime.4 Before
answering this question, the first issue to resolve is whether the phrase
“by his own hand, upon papyrus,” was part of the ancient Book of Abraham text or a modern statement by Joseph Smith or his scribes reflecting their beliefs about the nature of the papyri. Some evidence can be
interpreted to suggest that Joseph Smith and other early Latter-day
Saints believed the Egyptian papyri they acquired were as old as Abraham himself,5 although caution is necessary in evaluating this evidence,
since some of these sources are hearsay and “may have confused ‘written by the hand of Abraham’ (authorship) with ‘handwriting of Abraham’ (his personal penmanship).”6 Even if the phrase “written by his
own hand, upon papyrus,” reflects an assumption by Joseph Smith or
other nineteenth-century Latter-day Saints about the age of the papyri,
this would not necessarily diminish the historicity or authenticity of the

Book of Abraham for the same reason that Joseph Smith’s assumptions
about the contents of the Book of Mormon (such as its geography) as the
translator of that text do not necessarily diminish the Nephite record’s
historicity or authenticity.7
What’s more, in contrast to the manuscript version, this published
version of this statement in the Times and Seasons has commas that separate “written by his own hand” from the rest of the phrase, so that it
could be read as saying “purporting to be the writings of Abraham . . .
upon papyrus,” with everything else being parenthetical. It could even be
read as “some ancient records that have fallen into our hands, from the
catacombs of Egypt . . . upon papyrus,” merely stating on what medium
the writings came. To be sure, the manuscript version of the phrase
seems to push against this interpretation, given that the ordering of the
phrase makes it harder to separate “by his own hand” from “upon papyrus,” but the point still remains that the documentary evidence is not
altogether clear enough to know precisely what Joseph Smith may have
been assuming.
On the other hand, some scholars have argued that the phrase “the
Book of Abraham, written by his own hand, upon papyrus,” was the ancient
title of the text itself. As they have observed, the phrase “by his own hand,”

or something like it, was used in ancient Egypt simply to denote authorship.8 For example, one ancient Egyptian text features this line: “[If it (so)
happens] that you want to recite a writing, come to me, so that I can have
you taken to the place where this (particular) Book [lit. “papyrus”] is, of
which Thoth was the one who wrote it with his own hand, himself, when
he had come down after the (other) gods.”9
The literal idiom used here in ancient Egyptian is “with his own
hand” ([n-]Dr.t=f Ha=f), which indeed denotes authorship.10 A similar
idiom—“written . . . with his own fingers” (m Dbaw=f)—is also attested
in ancient Egypt as a way to attribute authorship.11 The idiom “by/in the
hand” to denote authorship, authority, or possession (“in the possession,
charge of,” “from,” “through,” “because of,” “be done by,” and so forth)
also appears in the Egyptian language as spoken in Abraham’s day (m-a),
reinforcing the possibility that the phrase was original to the ancient
text prepared by Abraham.12 (It even survives into Coptic, the latest and

messenger with a letter written by his enemy, the Hyksos king Apophis.
“For it was on the upland way of the oasis that I captured his messenger
going south to Kush with a written letter,” the stela says.14 The letter is
then reproduced on the stela in full.15 Although it is a copy of a text
that was almost certainly originally written by a court scribe, the letter is
nevertheless said in Kamose’s stela to have been literally written “by the
hand” of the Hyksos ruler, meaning it was from him or that he otherwise
claimed ownership of its content: “I found it [the letter; Sat] saying in
writing: ‘By the hand of the ruler of Avaris, Aa-User-Re, the Son of Re,
Apophis, hail to my son, the ruler of Kush.’”16
This phrase also appears in the Bible. For example, some prophetic
books speak of oracles or “the word of the Lord” coming through or by
certain prophets (for example, Mal. 1:1; Hag. 1:1; 2:1; Zech. 7:7, 12). The
literal Hebrew idiom in these passages, however, is “by/in the hand” (bĕ
yad). In the New Testament, some of Paul’s epistles conclude with a short
phrase indicating the Apostle wrote them “with his own hand,” even
though he surely employed scribes in helping him compose his letters,
and even after those letters were recopied by subsequent scribes (see 1
Cor. 16:21; Gal. 6:11; Col. 4:18; 2 Thes. 3:17; Philem. 1:19).17
Significantly, an “autobiography” of a Semitic ruler named Idrimi
from Abraham’s time attributes authorship of the text to the ruler himself while at the same time overtly mentioning the name of the scribe

who physically wrote the text.18 It would not be difficult to imagine a
similar situation where Abraham composed his record with the help of
scribes while nevertheless claiming ownership of and responsibility for
the text.
So whatever Joseph Smith and early Latter-day Saints may have
assumed about how old the papyri were or who physically wrote their
contents, the following conclusion can be reasonably drawn from the
surviving evidence:
The heading [of the Book of Abraham] does not [necessarily] indicate
that Abraham had written that particular copy but rather that he was
the author of the original. . . . A text, regardless of how many copies of it
exist in the world, is written by one author. However, each copy of that
text is a manuscript. . . . We all know that when an author of the ancient
world wrote something, if those writings were to survive or be disseminated, the text had to be copied again and again and again, for generation upon generation. When the heading states that the text was written
by Abraham’s own hand, it notes who the author is, not who copied
down the particular manuscript that came into Joseph’s possession.19

Chiasmus in the Book of Abraham
Chiasmus, or inverted parallelism, is “a two-part [literary] structure or system in which the second half is a mirror image of the
first, [that is,] where the first term recurs last, and the last first.”1 Most
Latter-day Saints who know about chiasmus have probably heard about
its presence in the Book of Mormon and the Bible.2 Chiasmus, however,
also appears in the Book of Abraham. For instance, the opening verses
of the Book of Abraham contains a chiasm highlighting Abraham’s right
to priesthood:
A It was conferred upon me
B from the fathers;
 C it came down from the fathers, from the beginning of time,
 D yea, even from the beginning,
 D′ or before the foundation of the earth,
 C′ down to the present time, even the right of the firstborn, or the
first man, who is Adam, or first father,
B′ through the fathers
A′ unto me. (Abr. 1:3, emphasis added)

Another chiasm appears in Abraham 3 that emphasizes the “selection
of . . . noble ones as rulers”3 on earth:
A Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that
were organized before the world was;
B and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones;
 C And God saw these souls that they were good,
 D and he stood in the midst of them,
 E and he said: These I will make my rulers;
 D′ for he stood among those that were spirits,
 C′ and he saw that they were good;
B′ and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them;
A′ thou wast chosen before thou wast born.
(Abr. 3:22–23, emphasis added)
What makes the presence of literary parallelism in the Book of Abraham significant besides being evidence for a “tight and deliberate literary
structure”4 of the text is that this type of literary device is “an unmistakable feature” of ancient Egyptian literature.5 This includes chiasmus
or inverted parallelism, which has been identified in Egyptian art and
architecture6 as well as in ancient Egyptian texts.7 This is seen in texts
from the time of Abraham such as the Stela of Sobk-Iry, which contains
a hymn to the god Osiris and features these lines:8

Since Abraham was not writing Egyptian literature for an Egyptian
audience, the significance of ancient Egyptian texts and the Book of
Abraham sharing common literary features like chiasmus and parallelism is noteworthy but should not be overstated. It seems that since Abraham was probably writing to those of his Semitic culture,12 the presence
of chiasmus in the Book of Abraham demonstrates the prevalence of
this literary feature in the ancient world generally, including Abraham’s
own culture, and can be viewed as a marker of the text’s ancient origin.
The presence of chiasmus in the Book of Abraham is therefore consistent with expectations that the text bears a high degree of historicity and
reinforces both its overall credibility and literary quality.

Egyptianisms in the Book of Abraham
One way of determining whether the Book of Abraham is a translation
of an underlying Egyptian document or whether it was originally
composed in English is to see if the text contains what might be called
Egyptianisms, or literary and linguistic features of the Egyptian language.
The presence of Egyptianisms in the text of the Book of Abraham “might
indicate some knowledge of Egyptian on Joseph Smith’s part.”1 Because
“Egyptian was not really understood in Joseph Smith’s day,”2 any knowledge of Egyptian Joseph Smith may have possessed could only have come
by revelation.
A careful reading of the Book of Abraham does reveal some potential
Egyptianisms in the English text. For example, “the earliest manuscript
containing Abraham 1:17 reads ‘and this because their hearts are turned
they have turned their hearts away from me.’ The phrase ‘their hearts are
turned’ was crossed out and ‘they have turned their hearts’ was written
immediately afterwards. In Egyptian of the time period of the Joseph
Smith Papyri the passive is expressed by the use of a third person plural.
So the two phrases would be identical in Egyptian. The translator has to
decide which way to render the passage.”3
Paronomasia, or wordplay, is another attested feature of ancient
Egyptian literature that also appears in the Book of Abraham.4 In

Abraham 3, the Lord showed Abraham a panoramic view of the cosmos
and then a vision of the spirits in the premortal council in heaven. Halfway through this vision, the Lord shifts from discussing the gradation
and hierarchy of heavenly bodies to discussing the gradation and hierarchy of spiritual beings:
Now, if there be two things, one above the other, and the moon be above
the earth, then it may be that a planet or a star may exist above it; and
there is nothing that the Lord thy God shall take in his heart to do but
what he will do it. Howbeit that he made the greater star; as, also, if there
be two spirits, and one shall be more intelligent than the other, yet these
two spirits, notwithstanding one is more intelligent than the other, have
no beginning; they existed before, they shall have no end, they shall exist
after, for they are gnolaum, or eternal. (Abr. 3:17–18, emphasis added)
This shift plausibly appears to pivot on a play on words in Egyptian.
The Egyptian word for “spirit” (Ax) resembles the word for the “light and
brilliance” (iAx) of celestial bodies, including stars, as well as the word for
the circumpolar stars (ixm), which were identified with the spirit of the
deceased king in texts predating Abraham.5 The Book of Abraham’s conceptual linkage of souls or spirits with heavenly bodies such as stars works
particularly well from an Egyptian perspective, since “the stars could
additionally be identified with the akhs [spirits] of the deceased by virtue
of these latter’s connection with the light and brilliance (iAx) typical of
celestial bodies.”6 This means that from an Egyptian perspective the astronomical teachings of the Book of Abraham “flow seamlessly into teachings about the preexistence which follow immediately thereafter.”7

Egyptianisms in the Book of Abraham 187
The question remains whether Abraham himself was responsible for
these Egyptianisms or whether they were the result of later scribes and
copyists. Abraham appears to have been writing to a non-Egyptian audience (presumably his own kinsfolk or descendants), and it is currently
unknown what language he originally spoke.8 While Abraham taught
the relationship between stars and spirits to the Egyptians, and their
own language and literary culture would have supported paronomasia,
it is possible that these Egyptianisms were introduced in the later copy of
Abraham’s writings that was preserved on the papyri acquired by Joseph
Smith. This, in turn, could potentially explain how Egyptianisms appear
in a text written for Abraham’s Hebrew posterity.

While these Egyptianisms in the Book of Abraham do not indisputably prove that Joseph Smith was translating from ancient Egyptian,
they are consistent with his claims to have done so.

Jews in Ancient Egypt
The Egyptian papyri acquired by Joseph Smith in 1835 can be confidently dated to many centuries after Abraham’s lifetime. Based on
several factors, it can be determined that the papyri were written in
a period when Egypt was governed by a dynasty of Greek rulers who
reigned from circa 300 to 30 BC.1 A question that readers of the Book of
Abraham might have is how a late copy of Abraham’s record originally
written sometime around 2,000–1,800 BC could have ended up in the
possession of an ancient Egyptian living many centuries later.
One plausible scenario is that Abraham’s descendants (ancient Israelites) transmitted the text over the centuries by copying it through succeeding generations in the same way that the books of the Bible were
written and copied over many centuries. But the Book of Abraham as
translated by Joseph Smith is said to have been preserved on Egyptian
papyri recovered “from the catacombs of Egypt” (Book of Abraham
heading). If Abraham’s descendants transmitted his record, how did it
end up in Egypt?
In fact, there is ample evidence that groups of ancient Israelites and
other Semitic peoples migrated into Egypt over the course of many centuries, taking with them their culture, religious practices, and sacred
texts.2 “Abraham himself was in Egypt, as was his great-grandson Joseph

and all of his Israelite descendants for hundreds of years thereafter. After
the Exodus, Israelites continued to travel to and live in Egypt. After the
Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem, large groups of Jews settled in
Egypt and created longstanding and thriving communities.”3
One of these migrations occurred during the time of the prophet Jeremiah. The Bible records “Judeans living in the land of Egypt, at Migdol,
at Tahpanhes, at Memphis, and in the land of Pathros” during this time
(Jer. 44:1, NRSV). These Jews had evidently fled into Egypt at the time of
the Babylonian conquest of the kingdom of Judah.4
Around this time a group of Jewish mercenaries traveled as far south
as the island of Elephantine on the Nile and not only established a thriving community but also built a temple to Yahweh (or Jehovah), the God
of Israel.5 They made copies of biblical texts that have survived today,
attesting to the existence of a thriving literary and religious culture in
their community.6
During the Greco-Roman period of Egyptian history (ca. 330 BC–
AD 400), ancient Jews built communities in many parts of Egypt. The
city of Alexandria on the coast of the Mediterranean was home to a
sizable Jewish community. Other Egyptian sites such as Leontopolis,

Jews in Ancient Egypt 191
Oxyrynchus, Thebes, and locations in the Fayum likewise had a Jewish
presence. In fact, ancient sources indicate that another temple to Yahweh was built at Leontopolis.7 Synagogues were likewise built at Alexandria and at sites in the Fayum.8
Evidence from surviving textual sources confirms that Jewish names
(including names such as Solomon, Aaron, Abraham, and Samuel) proliferated throughout Egypt. Summarizing this evidence, one scholar
wrote how “besides the Greeks, Jews were the most numerous group of
foreigners living in Egypt” during this time.9
There is also clear evidence that these Egyptian Jews copied their
sacred texts and even composed new texts while they lived in Egypt.
The Old Testament was translated into Greek in Alexandria during this
time, and stories about Abraham and other biblical figures circulated
among Jews living both inside and outside of Egypt.10 As has been
noted, “the Jews who had been coming into Egypt brought with them
their oral and written stories. Esteem for Abraham and stories about
him were part of Jewish identity and culture, regardless of where they
lived, but it was perhaps especially prominent in Egypt, where Abraham himself had spent some time.”11
So even though Abraham would have written his record many centuries earlier, there is plenty of historical evidence to suggest a plausible
way in which those writings could have been transmitted into Egypt at
any point over the course of many centuries.

Abrahamic Legends and Lore
As a central figure in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, there are many
extrabiblical traditions about the life of the patriarch Abraham. These
sources are important to study because they may contain distant memories of real events in Abraham’s life. It is also interesting to compare the
Book of Abraham with these sources because the Book of Abraham might
help us understand these extrabiblical sources better and vice versa.
Much of the Book of Abraham’s content that does not appear in the
Genesis account parallels the extrabiblical material from these religious
traditions.1 Just some of the unique elements in the Book of Abraham
that are found in ancient and medieval Jewish, Christian, and Islamic
sources include idolatry in Abraham’s day, a famine in the land of the

Chaldeans, an attempt to sacrifice Abraham, Abraham receiving a vision
of God and the cosmos, and Abraham being knowledgeable about
astronomy and teaching such to the Egyptians.2
For example, an early Christian author named Eusebius preserved an
account of Abraham teaching the Egyptians astronomy: “Abraham lived in
Heliopolis with the Egyptian priests and taught them much: He explained
astrology and the other sciences to them, saying that the Babylonians and
he himself had obtained this knowledge.”3 The ancient Jewish historian
Josephus likewise recorded that Abraham taught the Egyptians astronomy:
“He communicated to them arithmetic, and delivered to them the science
of astronomy; for, before Abram came into Egypt, they were unacquainted
with those parts of learning.”4 To be sure, mathematics and astronomy
were well-developed in Egypt by the time Abraham arrived for his brief
sojourn in that land. These reports by early Jewish and Christian writers
that depict Abraham as being the first one to introduce these sciences into
Egypt should not be taken at face value as factual historical reports. However, they are worth highlighting in this context since their overall depiction of Abraham as a learned astronomer parallels the Book of Abraham’s
account in some rather interesting ways. It should also be kept in mind
that the Book of Abraham does not actually claim that Abraham was the
first to teach the Egyptians astronomy. Facsimile 3 of the Book of Abraham is said to depict Abraham merely “reasoning” upon the principles of
astronomy in the king’s court, not introducing them for the first time.
Another recurring theme in these ancient extrabiblical accounts
about Abraham is his having a vision of the cosmos and being brought
into the presence of God.5 Medieval Jewish sources also speak of Abraham having in his possession a “glowing precious stone” with which he
read the stars and performed miracles:
Abraham wore a glowing stone around his neck. Some say that it was a
pearl, others that it was a jewel. The light emitted by that jewel was like

3. Tvedtnes, Hauglid, and Gee, Traditions about the Early Life of Abraham, 8–9. The
ancients tended to conflate the practices of “astrology” (studying the stars in an attempt
to detect their supposed influence on mortal lives and affairs) and “astronomy” (the scientific study of celestial objects and their movements) and viewed them as overlapping
endeavors. For this reason, the terms “astrology” and “astronomy” are often used interchangeably both in ancient sources and by modern scholars and translators working
with these sources. The modern bifurcation of these two practices (which also widely
regards the former as a pseudoscience) was not so neatly delineated by the ancients.

the light of the sun, illuminating the entire world. Abraham used that
stone as an astrolabe to study the motion of the stars, and with its help he
became a master astrologer. For his power of reading the stars, Abraham
was much sought after by the potentates of East and West. So too did that
glowing precious stone bring immediate healing to any sick person who
looked into it. At the moment when Abraham took leave of this world,
the precious stone raised itself and flew up to heaven. God took it and
hung it on the wheel of the sun.6
With a few exceptions, the extrabiblical sources that parallel the
account in the Book of Abraham were unavailable to Joseph Smith. Even
with those sources that could have been available to the him, such as the
writings of Josephus, it is not clear how much exposure or access Joseph
Smith had to them or how much they influenced his thinking.7 “Josephus was known to Oliver Cowdery and theoretically known to Joseph
Smith, but it is not clear that Joseph Smith actually read much, if anything, out of Josephus before he translated the Book of Abraham. While
some elements of the Book of Abraham agree with Josephus, there are
important disagreements as well.”8 For instance, unlike Josephus, the
Book of Abraham does not depict the patriarch as introducing mathematics or arithmetic to the Egyptians. It also specifically says Abraham
reasoned with the king and his court on astronomical matters, something also missing from Josephus. “In this respect, the Book of Abraham
account is actually closer to an account given by Artapanus, an ancient
Jewish author who lived in Egypt sometime before the first century BCE,
since he specifically reported that Abram taught Pharaoh astronomy.”9
It is also important to keep in mind that these later sources do not necessarily always reflect an accurate history of Abraham. “Not all [ancient]

University Press, 2004), 332, citing b. Bava Batra 16b; Zohar 1:11a–11b, Idra Rabbah. As
Schwartz comments, “this talmudic legend about a glowing stone that Abraham wore
around his neck is a part of the chain of legends about that glowing jewel, known as the
Tzohar, which was first given to Adam and Eve when they were expelled from the Garden of Eden and also came into the possession of Noah, who hung it in the ark. . . . This
version of the legend adds the detail that the glowing stone was also an astrolabe, with
which Abraham could study the stars.”

authors treated their sources the same way. Some authors retold the tales
they read in their own words, adding more vivid and imaginative details.
Other authors repeated their sources word for word. Some authors
expanded their stories, while others abbreviated them, and still others
left them unchanged. This makes it difficult to come up with a general
theory [for their reliability] that covers all cases.”10 What is important for
the Book of Abraham is not that these sources somehow prove the book
is true. Rather, they demonstrate that important themes and narrative
details in the Book of Abraham fit comfortably in the ancient world and
do not always fit comfortably in Joseph Smith’s nineteenth-century environment.11 “The nonbiblical traditions about Abraham underscore the
pervasive influence this great patriarch has had on ancient and modern
peoples. Because the Book of Abraham parallels so many nonbiblical
stories, it is clearly part of the same tradition.”12
While they perhaps do not rise to the level of proof, these parallels are
still evidence for the Book of Abraham because “it is difficult to argue
that Joseph Smith wrote the Book of Abraham using [these] Abrahamic stories because most of them were not available to him, and those
that were often contained details that do not match the Book of Abraham. On the other hand, the ancient existence of a Book of Abraham can
explain why these stories existed.”13

The Ancient Egyptian View of Abraham
Some might ask how likely it would have been for the ancient Egyptians to have known anything about the biblical figure Abraham. In
fact, evidence survives today indicating that stories about Abraham were
known to the ancient Egyptians as early as the time of the composition
of the Joseph Smith Papyri (ca. 330–30 BC).
The earliest documented appearance of the biblical story of Abraham
in ancient Egypt dates to the third century BC. It was at this time when
the Old Testament (or Hebrew Bible) was translated into Greek in the
Egyptian city of Alexandria. This translation is commonly called the Septuagint.1 In addition to the biblical text, extrabiblical stories about Abraham circulated in Egypt during this time. For example,
• “during the reign of Ptolemy I, Hecateus of Abdera traveled to Thebes and learned stories about Abraham from Egyptian priests; he
wrote these stories in a book called On Abraham and the Egyptians.
This work is now unfortunately lost, but Clement of Alexandria,
a second-century AD Egyptian Christian, quoted a short passage
from it in which the worship of idols is condemned.”2

• “The writer Eupolemus, who lived under Egyptian rule in Palestine in the second century BC, recounts how Abraham lived in
Heliopolis (On) and taught astronomy and other sciences to the
Egyptian priests. In connection with Abraham, Eupolemus seems
to think that the Egyptians descended from Canaan.”3
• “In the first century BC, the Egyptian Jew Artapanus wrote an
account of Abraham teaching astronomy to the Egyptian Pharaoh.”4
• “Philo, a first-century AD Egyptian Jew, claimed that Abraham studied astronomy, the motion of the stars, meteorology, and mathematics, and used his reasoning on these subjects to understand God.”5
• “The Testament of Abraham describes Abraham’s tour of the next
life before he dies. Scholars think that this work was written by an
Egyptian Jew around the first century AD. It is notable for its reinterpretation of the Egyptian judgment scene in a Jewish fashion.
This text was read liturgically the Sunday before Christmas during
the Egyptian month of Khoiak.”6
• “[A] fragmentary text from Egypt about Abraham describes how
the king (the word used is pharaoh) tries to sacrifice Abraham, but
Abraham is delivered by an angel of the Lord. Abraham later teaches
the members of the royal court about the true God using astronomy.”7

The Ancient Egyptian View of Abraham 199
An additional significant body of evidence for the Egyptian view of
Abraham comes from a collection of texts commonly called the Greek
Magical Papyri or the Theban Magical Library. This corpus of texts from
the ancient Egyptian city of Thebes preserves “a variety of magical spells
and formulae, hymns and rituals. The extant texts are mainly from the
second century B.C. to the fifth century A.D.”8 Significantly, many biblical names and figures are used in these texts alongside Egyptian and
Greek names and figures.9 The name for this common ancient phenomenon is syncretism, where elements of different religions or traditions
were harmonized together into a new “synthetic” religious paradigm.
In some important ways, the form of religion widely practiced by the
Egyptians during the time of the Joseph Smith Papyri was a highly syncretic one.
Why were biblical figures syncretized with Egyptian religious or
magical practices? We cannot know entirely for sure, but one very plausible reason is that “Israelite religious beliefs and stories had a number of
things to offer the Egyptians. . . . Israelite religion could offer the Egyptians stories associated with sanctity and sacred space, amulets, angels,
a personal relationship with deity, and a god who acted in history.”10
Whatever the exact reason might be,
a noncomprehensive list of nondivine names [in these texts] includes
Abimelech, Abraham, Adam, Ammon, Aziel, Dardanos, David, Emmanuel, Gabriel, Gomorrah, Isaac, Israel, Jacob, Jeremiah, Jerusalem, Judah,
Lot, Lot’s wife, Michael, Moses, Solomon, and even Osiris-Michael.
Names for the Israelite deity include Adonai, Adonai Sabaoth (as well as
just Sabaoth, which is more common), Elohim, El, God of the Hebrews,
Yaho (the abbreviated version of Jehovah that was often employed by
Jews in Egypt), and blessed Lord God of Abraham, along with many variations and combinations of these names and titles that undoubtedly refer

to the Hebrew God, such as “He who drew back the Jordan River,” or referencing the God who drove the winds at the Red Sea and met someone
at the foot of the Holy Mount to reveal his great name.11
Abraham and Moses were two popular figures used by these Egyptian priests in their magical practices.12 They were so popular, in fact,
that an early Egyptian Christian writer named Origen even voiced his
outrage that his pagan neighbors were invoking “the God of Abraham”
without properly knowing who Abraham really was.13
From the evidence of the Greek Magical Papyri, we can conclude
that “a group of priests from Thebes possessed, read, understood, and
employed biblical and extrabiblical texts, most especially texts about
Abraham and Moses.”14 This evidence, along with the other evidence for
a knowledge of Abraham circulating in ancient Egypt, bolsters confidence in the Book of Abraham’s authenticity by providing it with a plausible ancient Egyptian historical and literary context.15

The Ancient Owners of the
Joseph Smith Papyri
Thanks to the work of Egyptologists over the past decades, in addition to knowing what texts the extant Egyptian papyri acquired by
Joseph Smith in 1835 contain,1 we also know quite a bit about the ancient
owners of the papyri. Because Joseph Smith incorporated Facsimiles 1
and 3 of the Book of Abraham from vignettes or illustrations contained
on a papyrus now designated P. Joseph Smith I, XI–X, the identity of the
ancient owner of this papyrus may prove especially interesting. “From
the names, titles, and genealogies written on the Joseph Smith Papyri,
we know” the owner of this papyrus was a man named Hor (or Horos
in Greek).2 Hor lived during “about the same time period as the Rosetta

Stone” (that is, around 200 BC) and was a priest or prophet of three
Egyptian deities in the ancient city of Thebes.3 “As prophet, he was a
spokesman for various gods, who interacted with prophets on a regular
basis. As a prophet, Horos had been initiated into the temple’s sacred
places, which represented heaven, and had promised to maintain strict
standards of personal conduct and purity.”4
Being a priest or prophet in ancient Egypt had its privileges. For
example, a prophet like Hor “had access to the great Theban temple
libraries, containing narratives, reference works, and manuals, as well
as scrolls on religion, ritual, and history.”5 Hor lived at a time when
Egyptian religion was eclectic, with elements of “Greek, Jewish, and
Near Eastern traditions” making their way into Egyptian culture.6 “The
papyri owners also lived at a time when stories about Abraham circulated in Egypt. If any ancient Egyptians were in a position to know about
Abraham, it was the Theban priests.”7
The first god whom Hor served as a prophet was Amun-Re, whose
magnificent temple still stands today. As a prophet of this god, Hor
“would have gone into the holy of holies and would have encountered
the statue of the deity face to face. He also would have participated in the
daily execration ritual, in which a wax figure of an enemy was spat upon,
trampled under the left foot, smitten with a spear, bound, and placed on
the fire. He also would have known a creation account that starts with
God creating light and then separating out the dry land from the water,
followed by the creation of multiple gods who together plan the creation,
cause the sun to appear, and vanquish evil.”8
Hor was also a prophet of a god named Min-Who-Massacres-HisEnemies. This lesser-known god was a syncretized, or combined, deity
drawing from the Egyptian god Min and the Canaanite warrior-god
Resheph. “This deity was worshipped by performing human sacrifice
in effigy. Two rituals are known for certain: one involves the subduing
of sinners by binding them, and the other involves slaying enemies and
burning them on an altar. These rituals seem to have also been part of

the execration ritual that [Hor] would have performed as prophet of
[Amun-Re].”9
Finally, Hor was a prophet for the god Khonsu (or Chespisichis in
Greek). In this capacity he “was involved in a temple that dealt with healing people and protecting them from demons. The founding narrative
of this temple deals with a pharaoh who had extensive contact with farflung foreign lands, who takes any woman he thinks is beautiful as a wife,
and who asks for and receives directions from God. The narrative also
deals with the appearance of angels and God appearing in dreams to
give instructions.”10
By knowing these details about Hor and his occupation we might
be able to say something about the possibility of a text like the Book of
Abraham having attracted his interest or having come into his possession, or at the very least why the illustrations from his papyri (Facsimiles 1 and 3) were used by Joseph Smith to illustrate the Book of Abraham.
As a priest in Thebes, Hor would have been highly literate and would
have had access to texts about Abraham and other Jewish figures.11 As a
prophet of Amun-Re, he would have had an interest in themes such as
temple initiation, seeing God face-to-face, and creation. As a prophet of
both Amun-Re and Min-Who-Massacres-His-Enemies, he would have
“had a professional interest in . . . stories about slaughtering and then
burning people on an altar.”12 Finally, as a prophet of the god Khonsu,
he would have been attracted to a text that featured angels, contact with
foreign lands, and a king who takes any woman he thinks is beautiful.
These elements are, of course, prominent in the Book of Abraham.

Approaching the Facsimiles
As “the only illustrations in our scriptures,” the facsimiles of the Book
of Abraham “attract attention not only because of their rough-hewn
quality but by their very existence as a visual medium in the midst of
the written word.”1 Latter-day Saint scholars and interested laypersons
have offered a number of different approaches to understanding the
facsimiles.2 Some of the more common approaches to the facsimiles
include the following:

2. The facsimiles were original to Abraham but were modified over
time for use by the ancient Egyptians. The facsimiles as currently
preserved are much later and altered copies of Abraham’s originals.
To interpret them we should consider the underlying Abrahamic
elements and compare them with how the Egyptians understood
these images.3
3. The facsimiles were connected to the Book of Abraham when the
Joseph Smith Papyri were created in the Ptolemaic period (ca. 330–
30 BC). To interpret them we should look to what Egyptians of that
time generally may have thought these drawings represent.4
4. The facsimiles were connected to the Book of Abraham for the first
time in the Ptolemaic period, but to interpret them we should look
specifically to how Egyptian priests who were integrating Jewish,
Greek, and Mesopotamian religious practices into native Egyptian
practices would have understood them.5
5. The facsimiles were connected to the Book of Abraham in the Ptolemaic period, but to interpret them we should look to how Jews of
that era would have understood them.6
6.The facsimiles were never part of the Book of Abraham but instead
were completely reinterpreted by Joseph Smith to artistically depict
the text he revealed or translated. We can make sense of Joseph’s
interpretations by expanding our understanding of his role as a
“translator.”7
7. The facsimiles were never part of the Book of Abraham, but
Joseph Smith, by revelation, perceived the meaning of the figures
in their ancient Egyptian context and based on similarities syncretized many of them to details within the context of Abraham’s
life. To understand Joseph Smith’s explanations in this approach,
it is important to understand that some figures he interprets in
their ancient Egyptian context and some figures he overlays with
an Abrahamic detail due to perceived similarities between the

Egyptian and Abrahamic concepts. This approach still requires
an understanding of the figures in their ancient Egyptian context
but does not assume all of Joseph Smith’s explanations are how the
Egyptians would have strictly understood them.8
Each of these approaches has its respective strengths and weaknesses,
but each also requires certain assumptions at the outset in order to accept
it, and it appears that no one single explanation on its own can account
for all the available evidence. Although not all of these paradigms will
be explored here, a few examples illustrating this point are worth bringing up. For instance, the first paradigm is a more straightforward way
of thinking about the facsimiles but is severely undermined by the fact
that the Joseph Smith Papyri date to many centuries after Abraham’s lifetime.9 The second, third, and fourth paradigms are each compelling to
varying degrees since they can account for the instances where Joseph
Smith’s interpretations of the facsimiles align with those of other Egyptologists, but no single one of them can account for his interpretations in
their entirety from an Egyptological perspective.
Whichever paradigm one adopts, it seems clear that Joseph Smith’s
explanations of the facsimiles were original to himself (none of the explanations appear next to the illustrations on the papyri he possessed).10
“There are aspects of [these explanations] that match what Egyptologists
say they mean. Some [of them] are quite compelling. . . . However, as
we look at the entirety of any of the facsimiles, an Egyptological interpretation does not match what Joseph Smith said about them.”11 This
is complicated by the fact that even though not all of Joseph Smith’s

explanations of the facsimiles in their entirety agree with how modern

us to carefully unpack the assumptions we bring when approaching the

Approaching the Facsimiles 213
Despite some important advances in scholarship, “we [still] do not
[entirely] know to what we really should compare the facsimiles.” For
instance, we must ask if Joseph Smith meant to give us “an interpretation
[of the facsimiles] that ancient Egyptians would have held, or one that
only a small group of priests interested in Abraham would have held, or
one that a group of ancient Jews in Egypt would have held, or something
another group altogether would have held.” Or, alternatively, “was he
giving us an interpretation we needed to receive for our spiritual benefit
regardless of how any ancient groups would have seen these?” The fact is
that we don’t know for sure. While we “can make a pretty good case for the
idea that some Egyptians could have viewed Facsimile 1 the way Joseph
Smith presents it, [we are still] not sure that is the methodology we should
be employing. We just don’t know enough about what Joseph Smith was
doing to be sure about any possible comparisons, or lack thereof.”13
What is clear from all of this is that “much more work needs to be
done before we can understand the facsimiles in their ancient Egyptian
setting, and only then will it be meaningful to ask whether that understanding matches that of Joseph Smith (to the extent that we understand

even that).”14 For example, “Facsimile 3 has always been the most
neglected of the three facsimiles in the Book of Abraham. Unfortunately,
most of what has been said about this facsimile is seriously wanting at
best and highly erroneous at worst.”15 Some valuable work in recent years,
however, has helped remedy this by better situating this facsimile in its
ancient Egyptian context.16 As that context has become clearer, elements
of Joseph Smith’s explanations have become more plausible (although
other elements remain at odds with current Egyptological theories).
Whichever theoretical paradigm one adopts in approaching the facsimiles, a respectable case can be made that with a number of his explanations Joseph Smith accurately captured ancient Egyptian concepts (and
even scored a few bull’s-eyes with his explanations) that would have otherwise been beyond his natural ability to know.17 Any honest approach to
the facsimiles must recognize this and take this into account. At the same
time, however, this is not necessarily conclusive evidence that the facsimiles themselves were actually used as illustrations for Abraham’s record in
antiquity. For now, then, the best approach to the facsimiles would be to
remain open-minded and inquisitive and to keep asking the best questions based on the best available evidence and information.

A Semitic View of the Facsimiles
Latter-day Saint scholars and interested laypersons have offered a
number of different approaches to interpreting the facsimiles and
the validity of Joseph Smith’s interpretations.1 One such scholar, Kevin L.
Barney, has articulated an insightful theory for interpreting the facsimiles that is worth careful consideration.2
Responding to the legitimate questions that have been raised by
Egyptologists concerning Joseph Smith’s interpretations of the facsimiles, Barney proposed in a 2005 article “that the facsimiles may not
have been drawn by Abraham’s hand,” as has sometimes been assumed
by Latter-day Saints, “but may have been Egyptian religious vignettes
that were adopted or adapted by an Egyptian-Jewish redactor as illustrations of the Book of Abraham.” Barney further “illustrate[d the] general
processes of Jewish adaptation of Egyptian sources” by offering “three
specific examples from the Greco-Roman period (the same period when
the Joseph Smith Papyri were produced) that each relates in some way
to Abraham.” Using these examples, Barney concluded “that such Jewish
adaptation of Egyptian sources was common during this time period
and would explain the adaptation of the facsimiles to illustrate the Book
of Abraham, which may have come under this redactor’s care as part of
the ancient transmission of the text.”3 The first example cited by Barney

is the apocryphal Testament of Abraham (probably composed in Greek
in the first century AD in Egypt).
The Testament of Abraham tells the story of how when Abraham had
lived the full measure of his mortal existence, God sent the archangel
Michael—his “commander in chief ”—to inform Abraham so that he
might arrange his affairs prior to his death. Abraham refuses to follow Michael, however, and desires a tour of the whole inhabited world
before he dies. Michael and Abraham survey the world in a divine chariot, and whenever Abraham sees someone sinning he asks for the sinner
to be struck down. God then puts an end to the tour, since his own practice is to be patient with sinners in order to give them an opportunity to
repent. Abraham is then shown the judgment, which is the scene we will
examine in some detail below. Abraham repents of his harshness, and
the sinners who had been struck down at his request are restored to life.
Abraham, however, still refuses to follow Michael. So God sends Death,
who, by a deception, gets Abraham’s soul to accompany him, whence he
returns to the presence of God.4
The judgment scene in the Testament of Abraham, in particular, is
striking. As summarized by Barney,
Abraham sees two fiery-looking angels driving myriad souls to judgment.
The judgment hall is situated between a narrow gate for the use of the
righteous and a broad gate for the wicked. In the judgment hall there is a
terrifying throne, and seated on the throne is a wondrous man, with an
appearance like unto a son of God. In front of this figure is a crystal-like
table, covered with gold and fine linen. Resting on the table is a book. On
either side of the table are angels holding papyrus and ink. In front of the
table is a light-bearing angel holding a balance, and on his left is a fiery
angel holding a trumpet full of fire. The man on the throne judges the
souls. The two angels with papyrus record; the one on the right records
the deceased’s righteous deeds, and the one on the left records sins. The
angel with the balance weighs the souls, and the fiery angel tries them
with fire. Michael informs Abraham that this scene represents judgment
and recompense.
Abraham asks Michael specifically who all of these figures are and
is informed that the judge seated upon the throne is Abel, who judges
men until the Parousia (second coming). At the Parousia, everyone
is to be judged by the twelve tribes of Israel, and, finally, God himself
shall judge all men, so that the judgment may be established by three
witnesses. Michael tells Abraham that the angels on the right and left
4. Barney, “Facsimiles and Semitic Adaptation,” 116–17.
A Semitic View of the Facsimiles 217
record righteous deeds and sins. The sunlike . . . angel holding the balance is the archangel Dokiel, the righteous balance-bearer, who weighs
the righteous deeds and sins. The fiery angel who tests the works of men
with fire is the archangel Purouel. Everything is tested both by fire and
by balance.5
This, Barney rightly notes, is significant because the Testament of
Abraham appears to be drawing directly from the judgment imagery in
chapter 125 from the Egyptian Book of the Dead.6 As another scholar
has more recently argued, “There are many obvious parallels between
the Testament of Abraham and the traditional Egyptian judgment scene,
especially regarding the judgment by scales,” and it appears that the
author of the Testament of Abraham was “very familiar with Egyptian
judgment scenes” and perhaps even “playing with them as he had with
biblical figures to weave a memorable tale” and develop his understanding of the final judgment.7
The second example used by Barney is the attested syncretization of
the Egyptian god Osiris with the biblical figure of Abraham.8 As Barney
notes, some scholars have posited the dependence of Jesus’s parable of
Lazarus and the rich man in Luke 16:19–31 on an older Egyptian version of the story.9 In the Egyptian text known as the tale of Setne, a boy
named Si-Osiris (“son of Osiris”) and his father witness “two funerals:
first, that of a rich man, shrouded in fine linen, loudly lamented and
abundantly honored; then, that of a poor man, wrapped in a straw mat,
unaccompanied and unmourned. The father says that he would rather
have the lot of the rich man than that of the pauper.”10 To show his father
the folly of this way of thinking, Si-Osiris takes him to the underworld,
where the rich man who had an elaborate funeral is punished while the
pauper who had no dignified burial is glorified and exalted in the presence of the god Osiris himself. “The reason for this disparate treatment

is that, at the judgment, the good deeds of the pauper outweighed the
bad, but with the rich man the opposite was true.”11 As explained by
Barney, “Once again we are able to see how the Egyptian story has been
transformed in Semitic dress. . . . The ‘bosom of Abraham’ [from the
Lucan parable] represents . . . the Egyptian abode of the dead. And, most
remarkably, Abraham is a Jewish substitute for the pagan god Osiris—
just as is the case in Facsimiles 1 and 3.”12
Finally, Barney draws attention to another apocryphal text, the
Apocalypse of Abraham, “a kind of companion text to the Testament of
Abraham.” The Apocalypse of Abraham “tells the story of how Abraham
in his youth perceived that idols were simply creations of men and not
really gods. After leaving his father’s house, Abraham is commanded to
offer a sacrifice so that God will reveal great things to him. God sends
his angel Iaoel to take Abraham on a tour of heaven, during which he
sees seven visions.”13 Citing earlier work by Latter-day Saint Egyptologist Michael Rhodes,14 Barney points to “what appear to be possible
allusions to a hypocephalus [the kind of circular object that Facsimile 2
is] in the Apocalypse of Abraham.”
During his vision Abraham is shown “the fulness of the whole world
and its circle,” which appears to be a description of a hypocephalus. This
vision includes the plan of the universe, “what is in the heavens, on the
earth, in the sea, and in the abyss,” which are very close to the words
used in the left middle portion of the Joseph Smith hypocephalus. The
Apocalypse also includes a description of four fiery living creatures, each
with four faces: that of a lion, a man, an ox, and an eagle. This is almost
certainly a Semitic transformation of the Sons of Horus (via Ezekiel 1–2),
which are represented as figure 6 of Facsimile 2.15
Based on these examples, Barney argues that “studying only the
Egyptian context of the facsimiles will never yield a complete explanation of the significance of Joseph’s interpretations. We need to be able
to look at them the way [a hypothetical ancient Jewish redactor] did,
as Semitized illustrations of the Book of Abraham. When we see them

from this perspective, our vision gains clarity, and the facsimiles and
Joseph’s interpretations come into focus.”16
While this theory is compelling, it does require Latter-day Saints to
reject some traditional assumptions about the facsimiles, such as the
belief that, as preserved in the Joseph Smith Papyri, they were personally drawn by Abraham himself.17 This theory likewise presupposes a
more complex transmission of the Book of Abraham text than perhaps
traditionally recognized.18 However, acceptance of these two points to
accommodate Barney’s theory is by no means fatal to the inspiration
of the Book of Abraham and in fact may even help clear up some of the
objections Egyptologists have made against Joseph Smith’s interpretation of the facsimiles.19
Ultimately, there is still much to discuss and consider when it comes
to the interpretation of the facsimiles of the Book of Abraham. Barney’s
theory, while perhaps not definitive, is “valuable and attractive” and
offers important “new avenues for further research.”20 It also provides
one way to understand Joseph Smith’s interpretations of the facsimiles in
a plausible ancient light.21

21. There are several potential paradigms for evaluating Joseph Smith’s interpretations of the facsimiles, each resting on certain assumptions that require analysis and
unpacking. “There are aspects of Joseph Smith’s interpretations of the facsimiles that
match what Egyptologists say they mean. Some aspects are quite compelling, especially
for Facsimile 1. However, as we look at the entirety of any of the facsimiles, an Egyptological interpretation does not match what Joseph Smith said about them. That being said, we
do not know to what we really should compare the facsimiles. Was Joseph Smith giving us
an interpretation that ancient Egyptians would have held, or one that only a small group
of priests interested in Abraham would have held, or one that a group of ancient Jews
in Egypt would have held, or something another group altogether would have held, or
was he giving us an interpretation we needed to receive for our spiritual benefit regardless of how any ancient groups would have seen these? We do not know. While I can
make a pretty good case for the idea that some Egyptians could have viewed Facsimile 1
the way Joseph Smith presents it, I am not sure that is the methodology we should be
employing. We just don’t know enough about what Joseph Smith was doing to be sure

Facsimile 1 as a Sacrifice Scene
Facsimile 1 of the Book of Abraham visually depicts the narrative
contained in Abraham 1:12–19. As interpreted by Joseph Smith, this
scene depicts Abraham fastened upon an altar before some idolatrous
gods. An idolatrous priest is about to sacrifice Abraham, who is protected by the angel of the Lord.
Since the mid-1800s, when Egyptologists first began analyzing the
facsimiles of the Book of Abraham, Joseph Smith’s interpretation of this
scene (sometimes called a lion couch scene, due to the prominent lion
couch at the center of the illustrations) has clashed with Egyptological interpretations. In 1860, the French Egyptologist Théodule Devéria
interpreted Facsimile 1 as depicting the resurrection of the god Osiris.1
In 1912, Egyptologists interpreted Facsimile 1 as, variously, “the well
known scene of Anubis preparing the body of the dead man,”2 “a resurrection scene” showing “Osiris rising from the dead,”3 “an embalmer
preparing a body for burial,”4 “the body of the dead lying” on a funerary bier,5 and “a dead man . . . lying on a bier” and being prepared for
mummification.6 Similar interpretations of Facsimile 1 have been given
in more recent years.7

From the weight of this Egyptological opinion, it may seem strange to
associate Facsimile 1 with sacrifice as Joseph Smith did. However, more
recent investigation has turned up evidence that suggests a connection
between sacred violence and scenes of the embalming and resurrection
of the deceased (or the god Osiris). Evidence linking Osiris’s mummification and resurrection with execration rituals can be detected “in the roof
chapels of the Dendara Temple.”8 Other Egyptologists have already drawn
parallels between Facsimile 1 and the Dendara Temple scenes depicting
the resurrection of Osiris9 but have failed to notice the connection these
scenes make with ritual violence.10 For example, the inscription accompanying one such scene says of evildoers: “He will not exist, nor will his
name exist, since you will destroy his town, cast down the wall of his house,
and everyone who is in it will be set on fire; you will demolish his district;
you will stab his confederates, his flesh being ashes, the evil conspirator
consigned to the slaughterhouse so that he will no longer exist.”11
It may also be noteworthy in this regard that in these texts the word
for the “lion couch” (nmit) is homophonous, or nearly identical, with
the word for “abattoir, slaughterhouse” (nmt) as well as for “offerings”
(nmt).12 This homophony could plausibly have contributed to an association or relationship between the two words in the minds of some Egyptians, and examples from the Dendara Temple seem to indicate this. For
instance, “in the same chapel, we have depictions of Anubis and the sons
of Horus (presumably the figures under the lion couch in Facsimile 1)
holding knives.” The text accompanying these figures gives us a sense of
what purpose they serve in the scenes.

Facsimile 1 as a Sacrifice Scene 223
Anubis is here identified as the one “who smites the adversaries with his
might, since the knife is in his hand, to expel the one who treads in transgression; I am the violent one who came forth from god, after having cut
off the heads of the confederates of him whose name is evil.” The humanheaded son of Horus is identified above his head as “the one who repulses
enemies” and “who comes tearing out (šd) the enemies who butchers
(txs) the sinners.” The baboon-headed son of Horus says: “I have slaughtered those who create injuries in the house of God in his presence; I take
away the breath from his nostrils.” The jackal-headed son of Horus says:
“I cause the hostile foreigners to retreat.” Finally, the falcon-headed son of
Horus says: “I have removed rebellion (HAy).”13
From this and other evidence,14 it can be seen that at least some
ancient Egyptians associated scenes of the resurrection of Osiris with
the slaughter of enemies. Why might some ancient Egyptians have done
so? It may relate to the myth of the resurrection of the god Osiris, which
lion couch scenes were meant to depict. In the classic retelling of the
myth, Osiris was slain and mutilated by his evil brother, Seth. Through
the efforts of his sister-wife, Isis, the body of Osiris was magically reassembled and resurrected. The final vindication came when their son
Horus slew Seth in combat and claimed kingship.15 The element in this
myth of Horus slaying Seth and thereby the forces of chaos or disorder (including foreign peoples, rebels, and enemies of Pharaoh) might
explain why sacrifice may have been associated with embalming and
mummification in some contexts.16

Interestingly, a papyrus from the first century BC (not far removed
from the time of the Joseph Smith Papyri) “comments on the fate suffered in the embalming place during the initial stages of mummification
by one who was overly concerned with amassing wealth while alive.”17
As read in the text, “It is the chief of the spirits (=Anubis) who is first to
punish after the taking of breath. Juniper oil, incense, natron, and salt,
searing ingredients, are a ‘remedy’ for his wounds. A ‘friend’ who shows
no mercy attacks his flesh. He is unable to say ‘desist’ during the punishment of the assessor.”18 Commenting on this passage, Egyptologist
Mark Smith observes that in this text “the embalming table [the lion
couch] is also a judge’s tribunal and the chief embalmer, Anubis, doubles
as the judge who executes sentence. For the wicked man, mummification, the very process which is supposed to restore life and grant immortality, becomes a form of torture from which no escape is possible.”19
That Anubis had a role as judge of the dead, besides merely being an
embalmer, has previously been acknowledged by Egyptologists.20
One task Anubis fulfilled with this role was as a guard or protector
who “administer[ed] horrible punishments to the enemies of Osiris.”21
From surviving evidence it is apparent that “Anubis must have been
engaged in warding off evil influences, and it is conceivable that he did
so as a judge. . . . [One Egyptian text even] identifies Anubis as a butcher
slaying the enemies of Osiris while [another] states that such butchers
are in fact a company of magistrates.”22 As a “reckoner of hearts” (ip
ibw), Anubis was “the inflictor of the punishment . . . of the enemies” of
Osiris.23 So from the perspective of the ancient Egyptians, the process
of embalming and mummification included elements of ritual violence
against evildoers or agents of chaos. “The punishment of enemies by a
‘judge’ is simply a part of the protective ritual enacted in connection with
the embalmment of the deceased.”24

who observes that the role of Anubis in these Dendara embalming scenes is to act as
Facsimile 1 as a Sacrifice Scene 225
To be sure, there are still some significant differences in how
Joseph Smith interpreted the lion couch scene in Facsimile 1. For one
thing, embalming and mummification were only ever performed after
the death of a person and were never meant to inflict death or otherwise sacrifice the person on the lion couch. Likewise, Anubis and the
other figures attending to the mummification of the dead were meant
to slaughter the enemies of Osiris, certainly not the figure of Osiris on
the lion couch. This is therefore not to suggest that somehow Abraham
had already been killed and was then set to be mummified. Nor is it to
suggest that these parallels are perfect matches for how Joseph Smith
interpreted this scene. Rather, it is to say that “excluding a sacrificial
dimension to lion couch scenes” or scenes depicting the mummification
of Osiris, which is how Egyptologists have interpreted Facsimile 1, “is
un-Egyptian, even if we cannot come up with one definitive reading [of
Facsimile 1] at this time.”25

The Idolatrous Priest
(Facsimile 1, Figure 3)
The explanation accompanying figure 3 of Facsimile 1 of the Book of
Abraham identifies it as “the idolatrous priest of Elkenah attempting
to offer up Abraham as a sacrifice.” In order to gauge the validity of this
interpretation from an Egyptological perspective, assuming this is the
approach one wishes to take, a number of factors need to be considered.
The first issue to resolve is the matter of the lacunae, or missing pieces,
in the original papyrus fragment. As printed in the March 1, 1842, issue
of the Times and Seasons, figure 3 is shown as a standing figure with a
bald head and a drawn knife. In the original papyrus fragment, however,
the areas with the bald head and knife are currently missing. At some
unknown point by some unknown person, an attempt was made to fill
in the missing head of figure 3, although no such attempt was made to
fill in whatever is missing in the figure’s hand. Determining whether the
figure in the original papyrus is accurately represented in Facsimile 1 is
important, because it may affect the interpretation of this figure.
First, there is the question as to whether the knife being held by figure 3 could plausibly have been in the original vignette or illustration.
“The existence of the knife has been doubted by many because it does not
conform to what other Egyptian papyri would lead us to expect,”1 and so
some Egyptologists have denied the possibility that the knife was original
to this illustration (even if others have had no objection to the possibility).2

At least two different nineteenth-century eyewitnesses who examined the
papyri, however, reported seeing “a Priest, with a knife in his hand”3 or
“a man standing by [the figure on the lion couch] with a drawn knife.”4
The significance of this is that the presence of a knife in the original papyrus “has here been described by . . . eyewitness[es] whose description of
the storage and preservation of the papyri matches that of independent
contemporary accounts. . . . This gives us two independent eyewitnesses
to the presence of a knife on Facsimile 1, regardless of what we might
[otherwise] think.”5 As such, despite what some scholars assume should
be on the original papyrus, “it is not valid to argue that something does
not exist because it does not correspond to what we expect.”6
Furthermore, the crescent shape of the knife in figure 3’s hand is consistent with the shape of ancient Egyptian flint knives that were used in
ancient Egypt for, among other activities, “ritual slaughter” and execration rites.7 Indeed, “killing involving flint [knives] is connected in myth

sometimes obsidian) knife as a means of both destroying evil through
execration rituals and preparing the deceased for embalming (which in
some ways were conceptually linked in the minds of some ancient Egyptians) appears to have survived into the Ptolemaic Period.9 This strongly
reinforces the likelihood that the knife was original to the scene.

proposed by a number of
Egyptologists.10 That the figure originally had a jackal
headdress seems likely, since
traces of the headdress over
the left shoulder of figure 3
can be detected in the surviving papyrus fragment.
With these considerations in mind, the question
of identifying figure 3 comes
into play. Some Egyptologists
have identified this figure as a
priest,11 while others have insisted it is the god Anubis.12 That the figure
is Anubis seems plausible on account of “the black coloring of the skin”13
and the faint remaining traces of the jackal headdress over the figure’s left
shoulder. However, without a hieroglyphic caption for this figure,14 this

identification should be accepted cautiously, since Anubis is not the only
jackal-headed, black-skinned figure attested in Egyptian iconography.15
What’s more, the question as to whether the figure is a priest or the
god Anubis (or another jackal-headed god), or whether it originally had
a bald human head or a jackal head, appears to be a false dichotomy. “The
practice of masking for ritual and ceremonial purposes seems to have
been important in Egypt from the earliest times and continued to be an
element of ritual practice into the Roman period,”16 and “priestly impersonators of Anubis regularly appear in funerary ceremonies, and are
styled simply Inpw, ‘Anubis’ or rmt-Inpw, ‘Anubis-men’ . . . [or] ink Inpw,
‘I am Anubis.’”17 At the Hathor temple of Deir el-Medineh, for example,
is a depiction of a ritual taken from chapter 125 of the Book of the Dead,
which shows “the king offering incense, and a priest masked as Anubis
beating a round frame drum.”18
Similarly, frescoes at the site of Herculaneum depict “ceremonies of
the cult of Isis as held in Italy in the first century CE.”19 This ritual scene
features a number of priests and priestesses, including one figure who
has been variously interpreted as the god Osiris or a priest dressed up
as the god Bes and disguised with a mask. “Although the Herculaneum
dancer probably represents a masked participant impersonating the god,
the matter [would have been] theologically unimportant” to the ancient
viewers of this scene, since the priest “masked as Bes” performing the
ritual would, for all intents and purposes, have assumed the identity of
15. As noted in Gee, “Eyewitness, Hearsay, and Physical Evidence of the Joseph
Smith Papyri,” 208 n. 38, the figure could potentially be the jackal-headed god Isdes
(who, incidentally, wields a knife). See Christian Leitz, Lexikon der ägyptischen Götter

the god himself in that ritual capacity.20 All of this holds clear significance for Joseph Smith’s interpretation of this figure in Facsimile 1.21
If we assume for the sake of argument that the head of figure 3 of
Facsimile 1 is correct, and that the figure originally had a bald head, then
what might the implications be for identifying this figure? “Shaving was a
common feature of initiation into the priesthood from the Old Kingdom
through the Roman period” and would thus be consistent with identifying this figure as a priest. But what if we assume, on the other hand, that
the head on figure 3 was originally a jackal. What then? Not only do we
have “representations of priests wearing masks,” but we also have examples of actual masks, as well as “literary accounts from non-Egyptians
about Egyptian priests wearing masks.” What’s more, there is at least one
written account of when a priest would wear a mask. “In the midst of
the embalmment ritual, a new section is introduced with the following
passage: ‘Afterwards, Anubis, the stolites priest wearing the head of this
god, sits down and no lector-priest shall approach him to bind the stolites
with any work.’ Thus this text settles any questions about whether masks
were actually used. It furthermore identifies the individual wearing the
mask as a priest.”22

of Ihy/Hathor. “The word iAs can refer to the baldness of all Egyptian priests, but it can
also recall the intermediary statues of the ‘bald ones of Hathor,’ who relay the words
of the goddess. The word iHy can indicate the god, who offers the deceased protection,
renewal, and rejuvenation, but it can also refer to the iHy-priests, whose feather headdresses in the determinatives emphasize their roles in music and dancing—a necessity
for pacifying Hathor’s dangerous side.” Richter, “Gods, Priests, and Bald Men,” 535.

papyrus—would also be consistent with identifying this figure as a priest
(specifically a class called the sem-priest), who is “recognizable by his
leopard-skin robe” and certain hairstyles. Interestingly, and perhaps
significantly for Joseph Smith’s interpretation of Facsimile 1, the ritual
clothing of the sem-priest had a clear connection to the god Anubis
defeating chaos and evil, personified as the god Seth, through violence.
“Papyrus Jumilhac, dating to the Ptolemaic Period (ca. 300 BC), attempts
to explain the significance of the leopard skin through a myth that relates
the misdeeds of the god Seth. As told in the papyrus, Seth attacked Osiris
and then transformed himself into a leopard. The god Anubis defeated
Seth and then branded his pelt with spots, hence the robe commemorates the defeat of Seth.”23 Also in Papyrus Jumilhac, Anubis transforms
himself into a giant snake who brandishes two flint knives.24
So even if some “issues concerning the accuracy of both the artwork
and the copying [of Facsimile 1]” remain unanswered at the moment
(issues which, unfortunately, “are routinely clouded by shifting the
responsibility of the artwork from the engraver, Reuben Hedlock, to
Joseph Smith, without adducing any evidence to identify a particular
individual with the responsibility for the restorations”25), the identification of this figure as a priest is not outside the realm of possibility from
an Egyptological perspective.

Facsimile 2 of the Book of Abraham is a type of document called a hypocephalus. “The term ‘hypocephalus’ refers to a piece of Late Period
and Ptolemaic [ca. 664–30 BC] funerary equipment. It is specifically,
an amuletic disc, made of cartonnage, bronze, textile, and more rarely,
papyrus, or even wood, emulating a solar disc.”1 The name was coined by
modern Egyptologists beginning with Jean-François Champollion and
comes from Greek, meaning literally “under the head.”2 Spell 162 of the
ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead specifies that these amulets were to
be placed Xr tp of the mummy, which has been widely rendered as “under
the head” of the mummy.3
Today there are 158 known hypocephali that have been catalogued or
published.4 Based on their attested chronological and geographical distribution, “it is clear that the use of the hypocephalus never became widespread”
in ancient Egypt. Instead, they “remained exclusive pieces of funerary
equipment reserved for the clergy and for the members of their families

purpose to the “classic” flat disc-shaped hypocephalus have also been identified. See

who occupied also priestly positions in the pallacide of the temples,” especially the temple of Amun at Karnak, the temple of Min at Akhmim, and the
temple of Ptah at Memphis.5 Although hypocephali themselves appear to be
later creations, the mythological and cosmological conceptions contained
in hypocephali have apparent forerunners in earlier Egyptian texts.6
According to Spell 162 of the Book of the Dead, hypocephali served
a number of important purposes: to protect the deceased in the afterlife,
to provide light and heat for the deceased, to make the deceased “appear
again like one who is on earth” (that is, to resurrect them), and to ultimately transform the deceased into a god.7 Hypocephali were also conceived of (and even sometimes explicitly identified as) the magical eye
of the sun god Re that consumed enemies with fire. Their circular shape
and function of providing light, heat, and protection naturally lent themselves to this conceptualization in the minds of the ancient Egyptians.8
Because there are so many extant hypocephali with varied features that
draw on often arcane or easily misunderstood aspects of ancient Egyptian myth and religion, different methodologies have been used to try to
understand this type of document with sometimes very different results.
“Just as the evidence left from the past often leaves itself open to multiple
interpretations, so also multiple methodologies may be used to examine and analyze that evidence. The researcher must make choices about
which legitimate methods to use. Different methods sometimes yield different results.”9 For this reason, any modern interpretation of the meaning of the figures and texts contained on hypocephali should always leave
room for the possibility of a plurality of approaches.10

While these might perhaps have been the primary purposes of hypocephali, it is clear from the explanatory rubric of some copies of Spell 162
of the Book of the Dead and from other surviving evidence that they also
served other roles. For example, hypocephali (or objects that served the
same purpose as hypocephali) may have been used as divinatory devices
in the Egyptian temple and as astronomical documents.11 This is especially
significant since Joseph Smith’s interpretation of Facsimile 2 draws connections to modern temples and features several astronomical elements.
Hypocephali also shared a conceptual link with temple gates. In this
capacity, they served, among other things, to keep out enemies and admit
friends into sacred space and shared a focus on creation motifs.12 Furthermore, hypocephali illustrate everything that the sun encircles, including
the world of the living on the top and the underworld on the bottom. In
this regard, hypocephali sought to capture the aspect of the cyclical rebirth
of the sun, which was conceptualized as (re)creation.13 Once again, this
parallels Joseph Smith’s explanations of Facsimile 2, which emphasize
themes of creation. While hypocephali served a number of important
religious and ritual purposes for the ancient Egyptians, they ultimately
“point[ed] toward the Egyptians’ hope in a resurrection and life after death
as a divine being.”14
Finally, it is noteworthy that there appear to have been ancient connections between Abraham and the hypocephalus. For example, in one
Egyptian papyrus, Abraham is referred to as “the pupil of the wedjat-eye”
and associated with the primeval creator god.15 “Moreover, in view of
the representations of Amon in the centre panel of the discs, hypocephali

Egyptian Texts,” 61, explains, “The wedjat-eye was a symbol of perfection, prosperity,

are properly equivalent in the Egyptian belief system with the pupil of
the wedjat-eye itself.”16 Michael D. Rhodes has also drawn attention to a
possible allusion to the hypocephalus in an extrabiblical text that prominently features Abraham.
The Apocalypse of Abraham describes a vision Abraham saw while making a sacrifice to God. In this vision he is shown the plan of the universe,
“what is in the heavens, on the earth, in the sea, and in the abyss” (almost
the exact words used in the left middle portion of the Joseph Smith Hypocephalus). He is shown “the fullness of the whole world and its circle,” in
a picture with two sides. The similarity with the hypocephalus is striking.
There is even a description of what are clearly the four canopic figures
labeled number 6 in the Joseph Smith Hypocephalus. The significance
of these documents is that they date from the beginning of the Christian era—they are roughly contemporary with the hypocephalus and the
other Egyptian documents purchased by Joseph Smith—and they relate
the same things about Abraham that Joseph Smith said are found in the
hypocephalus and the other Egyptian papyri.17
Besides being interesting and informative in its own right, understanding the purpose and function of the ancient Egyptian hypocephalus is therefore crucial to evaluating Joseph Smith’s interpretation of
Facsimile 2 and to helping readers of the Book of Abraham better appreciate why such a document might have been recontextualized by the
Prophet to illustrate Abraham’s record.

One Day to a Cubit
(Facsimile 2, Figure 1)
One of the more puzzling comments in the Book of Abraham comes
from the explanation given in figure 1 of Facsimile 2, which speaks
of “the measurement according to celestial time [of Kolob], which celestial time signifies one day to a cubit.” Latter-day Saint commentators on
this passage have largely been at a loss to explain what this might mean.1
(A cubit, after all, is a unit for measuring length, not time.2) Others have
attempted to make sense of this by suggesting that “as one of Kolob’s days
is a unit of celestial time, so the cubit is the unit of celestial measurement,
by which the size of the worlds are measured when the foundations
thereof are laid”;3 or that this describes the phenomenon of space-time;4
or that the text is “employing a symbolic multiplier of length parallel to
the multiplier of time, whereby a day is a thousand years.”5
More recently, Latter-day Saint scientist Hollis R. Johnson proposed
“a straightforward scientific explanation for the rather curious phrase.”
According to Johnson, “It is quite possible that the phrase describes

Pearl of Great Price: A Verse-by-Verse Commentary (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2005),
290, who simply admit that they “do not know how to interpret this.”
2. The cubit was used, in both standardized and nonstandardized forms, throughout
the ancient Mediterranean world, including Egypt and Canaan. See, generally, Antoine
Pierre Hirsch, “Ancient Egyptian Cubits—Origin and Evolution” (PhD diss., University
of Toronto, 2013); and Marvin A. Powell, “Weights and Measures,” in The Anchor Bible
Dictionary, ed. David Noel Freedman, 6 vols. (New York: Doubleday, 1992), 6:897–901.

exactly the movement of the brightest celestial object, the sun, as it
moves among the stars during the course of a year, a reflection of the
earth’s orbital motion.”6 As Johnson noted, while the cubit was widely
used in the ancient world to measure length, it was also used by some
ancient astronomers to measure angles. Johnson cites a Mesopotamian
text from the fourth century BC, for example, that recorded “daily positions of the moon and the planets visible above the local horizon.” One
translation of the text reads: “Night of the 20th, last part of the night, the
moon was [nn cubi]ts below β Geminorum, the moon being ⅔ cubit
back to the west. The 21st, equinox; I did not watch. Ni[ght of the 22nd,
last part of the night,] [the moon was] 6 cubits [below] ε Leonis, the
moon having passed ½ cubit behind α Leonis. Night of the 24th, clouds
were in the sky.”7
This text records the angular position of the moon relative to various stars in the constellations Gemini and Leo and records those angles
in cubits. Other Mesopotamian astronomical texts calculated the position of planets the same way.8 “Shorter apparent distances were sometimes designated by the cubit, subdivided into 30 fingers. The cubit had
an astronomical application for measuring distances in the heavens
between fixed stars and the meridian, for example, or between planets
and ecliptical stars, as well as for measuring eclipse magnitude.”9 The
ancient Egyptians likewise measured angles in cubits.10 So, Johnson

Mesopotamia,” Journal of the Ancient Near Eastern Society 24 (1996): 40, who notes
that the “ideal 360 day astronomical year [attested as early as the fourth millennium
BC] corresponded to an ancient Mesopotamian astronomical theory known from first
millennium B.C.E. astronomical texts which held that the stars, sun, and moon moved
along 360° circuits. According to this model, each day of the ideal astronomical year of
360 days corresponded to 1° of stellar or solar movement.”
10. Dieter Arnold, Building in Egypt: Pharaonic Stone Masonry (New York: Oxford
University Press, 1991), 11–13.
One Day to a Cubit (Facsimile 2, Figure 1) 249
argues, “the phrase one day to a cubit in the Book of Abraham seems to
refer to angular velocity rather than linear velocity. With this changed
perspective, we can readily interpret the otherwise opaque passage one
day to a cubit as an excellent description of the motion of the sun as it
passes among the stars and constellations during the course of a year.”11
Using the cubit to measure this angular velocity would have been relatively easy or simple for Abraham and other ancients. “An observer, even
with crude instruments, or even with the hand itself, can make simple
measurements to yield angular information about objects close together
in the sky—measurements in which the pointer finger at arm’s length
subtends an angle of about a degree, called a ‘cubit’ by the ancients.”12
Of course, since the measurement of Kolob, rather than the sun, is
said to be “one day to a cubit,” Johnson’s argument needs to be slightly
tweaked: “With the extended perspective that a cubit is an angle of a
degree, the curious phrase one day to a cubit from the Book of Abraham describes precisely the movement of [Kolob].”13 Overall, this rings
plausible, especially since the placement of Kolob in the cosmology of
Abraham 3 is relative to other observable celestial bodies (Abr. 3:9, 12–13).
And if Kolob is to be identified with the dog star Sirius, as some have
argued,14 this would provide a bright visible object in the night sky by
which to calculate angular velocity as described by Johnson. So, while
the precise meaning of “one day to a cubit” remains elusive, a reasonable
interpretation of the phrase that finds precedent in the ancient world
can be and indeed has been made.

The Hathor Cow
(Facsimile 2, Figure 5)
Figure 5 in Facsimile 2 of the Book of Abraham, a figure of an
upside-down cow, is identified by Joseph Smith with this elaborate
explanation:
Fig. 5. Is called in Egyptian Enish-go-on-dosh; this is one of the governing planets also, and is said by the Egyptians to be the Sun, and to borrow
its light from Kolob through the medium of Kae-e-vanrash, which is the
grand Key, or, in other words, the governing power, which governs fifteen
other fixed planets or stars, as also Floeese or the Moon, the Earth and the
Sun in their annual revolutions. This planet receives its power through
the medium of Kli-flos-is-es, or Hah-ko-kau-beam, the stars represented
by numbers 22 and 23, receiving light from the revolutions of Kolob.
From the viewpoint of current Egyptological knowledge, some aspects
of this explanation find plausible confirmation from the ancient Egyptians, while other aspects remain unconfirmed.1 One of the elements of
this explanation which finds confirmation from the ancient Egyptians is
Joseph Smith’s identification of this figure as the sun.2
The identity of this figure is not always easy to establish, since the
ancient Egyptians represented various deities and composite-deities

with bovine features,3 and because not all hypocephali consistently feature this figure.4 Thankfully, however, this figure is featured in some
hypocephali and labeled with hieroglyphs often enough to make identifying it not impossible. The name given to this figure in some hypocephali is that of the goddess Hathor (Hwt-Hr).5 Additional names sometimes
given to this figure are Ihet (iht/Aht) and Mehet-Weret (mHt-wrt), who
are both cow goddesses “commonly identified with Isis or Hathor.”6
Although this figure is not labeled in the hypocephalus reproduced as
Facsimile 2, it is safe to assume that it is very likely the cow goddess
Hathor or one of her closely associated divine emanations.
One of the “most important and popular” goddesses in ancient
Egypt, Hathor took on many roles and characteristics over the course
of her worship during prehistoric times in Egypt all the way down to
the Roman Period some three thousand years later. “She was most commonly represented as a cow goddess. Her manifestations and associated
activities were numerous and diverse, and complementary aspects such
as love and hate, or creation and destruction, characterized her from the
earliest stages of her worship.” What’s more, “her aspects [also] incorporated animals, vegetation, the sky, the sun, trees, and minerals, and
she governed over the realms of love, sex, and fertility, while also maintaining a vengeful aspect capable of the destruction of humanity.” When
represented as a cow or as a human female with cow horns, she “usually
bears the sun disk between [her] horns.”7
This last detail, though small, is significant for Joseph Smith’s interpretation of this figure. Hathor, especially in her bovine form, is frequently
but not necessarily always identified in Egyptian texts as the mother and
guardian of the sun disc as it is reborn each morning.8 She is sometimes

8. Mekis, Hypocephalus, 55–57, discusses the identity of this cow figure in hypocephali and the standing figure with an encircled wedjat-eye for its head that often appears
behind the cow holding a lotus or other object (as it does in Facsimile 2). According to
The Hathor Cow (Facsimile 2, Figure 5) 253
identified as both the consort and daughter of Re, the sun god, and is
frequently identified as “Eye of Re.” She is featured prominently in one
myth involving the sun god Re where she devours enemies with a fiery
solar glare from her eyes(s).9
That the goddess Hathor had an unmistakable solar component among
her various divine identities and functions is recognized widely among Egyptologists.10 “Hathor was closely connected with the sun god Re whose disk
she wears,” writes Richard Wilkinson. “Thus, Hathor played an important
role in the royal sun temples of the later Old Kingdom, and her mythological relationship with the sun god was firmly established. As the ‘Golden One’
she was the resplendent goddess who accompanied the sun god on his daily
journey in the solar barque.”11
By the likely time Facsimile 2 was drawn, Hathor was being identified
by some ancient Egyptians as not only the mother and protector of the
sun disc but as the sun itself. “Like her companion, the sun god Re, Hathor
[was sometimes identified as] a fiery solar deity.”12 One inscription from
the Hathor Temple at Dendera makes this identification explicit: “[The
goddess] Keket . . . praises Hathor of the sun: . . . ‘Hail to you, Female Sun,
Mistress of Suns’” (inD Hr.t rayt Hnwt n(.t) raw).13 Commenting on this
text, Egyptologist Barbara Richter explains,
The [play on words] on the root ra, “sun,” first as the feminine singular
substantive rayt, “Female Sun,” and then as the plural substantive raw,
“suns,” emphasizes not only that Hathor is the sun, but also that she is
mistress of all other solar deities. Furthermore, because Keket [is a goddess who] represents [primordial] darkness, it is appropriate that she
praises Hathor as the “Female Sun,” the bringer of light. . . . The text, iconography, and imagery of [this] scene [in the temple] allude to Hathor
as the rising sun at its first illumination of the earth.14
Mekis, the Celestial Cow could be the personification of a variety of goddesses, including Nut and Neith but also Hathor and Mehet-Weret, while the standing figure “is one of
the typical night forms of the sun-god” (55).

At the temple of Esna, this cow figure is identified as Ihet and
described as follows:
The very great cow, who gives birth to her children through her rites,
the guardian of her houses who creates the two encirclers in her form
of the golden cow, the great horizon, which lifts up the two lights
[the sun and the moon] in her belly: she has driven out darkness and
brought light. She has lit up Egypt by what came forth from her. She
is the divine mother of Re [the sun god], who created light through
her creation, who created what exists after her creation, who caused
Orion to sail the southern heaven after her, who sealed the dipper in
the northern heaven before her. She is [the goddess of the sky] Nut who
carries the stars pertaining thereto with her orbit, who strings the bow,
so that the decans [stars] tread in her place.15
The imagery in this inscription depicts “a golden cow who bears or creates the two encirclers (dbnyw) or two great lights (hAyti) being the sun
and moon. . . . These drive out darkness, bring in light, and lighten the
land. She is also connected with the stars, fixing them in their places and
orbits. . . . She is explicitly connected with the horizon, but at the same
time, since ‘she has driven out darkness, and she has lit up Egypt’ she is
identified with the sun. Thus this figure is horizon, sky, and sun.”16 There
is nothing obvious in figure 5 of Facsimile 2 that lends itself to being
identifiable as the sun to somebody who is idly speculating about what
it might mean. So, while not all of Joseph Smith’s explanation of this
figure currently finds immediate confirmation, the fact that at least one
important element of his explanation does find confirmation from the
ancient Egyptians indicates that the Prophet was doing something more
than simply guessing.

The Four Sons of Horus
(Facsimile 2, Figure 6)
Figure 6 of Facsimile 2 of the Book of Abraham was interpreted
straightforwardly by Joseph Smith as “represent[ing] this earth in
its four quarters.”1 Based on contemporary nineteenth-century usage of
this biblical idiom (Rev. 20:8), Joseph Smith evidently meant the figures
represent the four cardinal points (north, east, south, and west).2 This
interpretation finds ready support from the ancient Egyptians.
The four entities in figure 6 represent the four sons of the god Horus:
Hapi, Imsety, Duamutef, and Qebehsenuef.3 Over the span of millennia
of Egyptian religion, these gods took on various forms as well as mythological roles and aspects.4 One such role was, indeed, as representing the

four cardinal directions. “By virtue of its association with the cardinal
directions,” observes one Egyptologist, “four is the most common symbol of ‘completeness’ in Egyptian numerological symbolism and ritual
repetition.”5 As another Egyptologist has summarized,
The earliest reference to these four gods is found in the Pyramid Texts
[ca. 2350–2100 BC] where they are said to be the children and also the
“souls” of [the god] Horus. They are also called the “friends of the king”
and assist the deceased monarch in ascending into the sky (PT 1278–79).
The same gods were also known as the sons of Osiris and were later said
to be members of the group called “the seven blessed ones” whose job
was to protect the netherworld god’s coffin. Their afterlife mythology led
to important roles in the funerary assemblage, particularly in association with the containers now traditionally called canopic jars in which
the internal organs of the deceased were preserved. . . . The group may
have been based on the symbolic completeness of the number four alone,
but they are often given geographic associations and hence became a
kind of “regional” group. . . . The four gods were sometimes depicted
on the sides of the canopic chest and had specific symbolic orientations,
with Imsety usually being aligned with the south, Hapy with the north,
Duamutef with the east and Qebesenuef with the west.6
This understanding is shared widely among Egyptologists today. James P.
Allen, in his translation and commentary on the Pyramid Texts, simply identifies the four Sons of Horus as “representing the cardinal
directions.”7 Manfred Lurker explains that “each [of the sons of Horus]
had a characteristic head and was associated with one of the four cardinal points of the compass and one of the four ‘protective’ goddesses”
associated therewith.8 Geraldine Pinch concurs, writing, “[The four
Sons of Horus] were the traditional guardians of the four canopic jars
used to hold mummified organs. Imsety generally protected the liver,
Hapy the lungs, Duamutef the stomach, and Qebehsenuef the intestines.
The four sons were also associated with the four directions (south, north,
east, and west) and with four vital components for survival after death:

the heart, the ba, the ka, and the mummy.”9 “They were the gods of the
four quarters of the earth,” remarks Michael D. Rhodes, “and later came
to be regarded as presiding over the four cardinal points. They also were
guardians of the viscera of the dead, and their images were carved on
the four canopic jars into which the internal organs were placed.”10 Yet
another Egyptologist, Maarten J. Raven, argues that the primary purpose of the sons of Horus was to act as “the four corners of the universe
and the four supports of heaven, and only secondarily with the protection of the body’s integrity.”11
The association of the Sons of Horus with the earth’s cardinal directions is explicit in one scene where, represented “as birds flying out to the
four corners of the cosmos,” they herald the accession of king Ramses II
to the throne:12
Imsety, go south that you may declare to the southern gods that Horus,
[son of] Isis and Osiris, has assumed the crown and the King of Upper
and Lower Egypt, Usermaatre Setepenre [Ramses II], has assumed the
crown; Hapi, go north that you declare to the northern gods that Horus,
[son of] Isis and Osiris, has assumed the crown and the King of Upper
and Lower Egypt, Usermaatre Setepenre [Ramses II], has assumed the
crown; Duamutef, go east that you may declare to the eastern gods
that Horus, [son of] Isis and Osiris, has assumed the crown and the
King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Usermaatre Setepenre [Ramses II],
has assumed the crown; Qebehsenuef, go west that you may declare to
the western gods that Horus, [son of] Isis and Horus, has assumed the

orientation systems can be observed. The Sons of Horus can either occupy corner positions on coffins or canopic chests (Amset in the north-east, Hapy north-west, Duamutef
south-east, and Qebehsenuef south-west; both pairs change places in the New Kingdom),
or they are represented on the four side walls (Amset south, Hapy north, Duamutef east,
and Qebehsenuef west). In the latter case, the corner positions are often taken by four
protective goddesses. Obviously, the notions of the corners of the universe and of the
four points of the compass were not clearly distinguished.”

While Joseph Smith’s succinct interpretation of figure 6 in Facsimile 2
might have left out some additional details we know about the Sons of
Horus (whose roles evolved over the span of Egyptian religious history),
it nevertheless converges nicely with current Egyptological knowledge.14

God Sitting upon His Throne
(Facsimile 2, Figure 7)
Figure 7 in Facsimile 2 is identified as follows: “Represents God sitting
upon his throne, revealing through the heavens the grand Key-words
of the Priesthood; as, also, the sign of the Holy Ghost unto Abraham,
in the form of a dove.” Appearing in several other ancient Egyptian
hypocephali,1 the sitting personage in figure 7 has been described by one
Egyptologist as “a polymorphic god sitting on his throne” with “his back
[in] bird-form, while one of his arms is raised like that of [the gods] Min
or [Amun] and hold[ing] forth a flagellum.” Standing next to him is a
“falcon- or snake-headed snake” believed to perhaps be the minor deity
Nehebkau, who “offers the wedjat-eye.”2
Another Egyptologist has similarly described this figure as “a seated
ithyphallic god with a hawk’s tail, holding aloft a flail. This is a form of
Min . . . perhaps combined with Horus, as the hawk’s tail would seem to
indicate. Before the god is what appears to be a bird presenting him with
a Wedjat-eye.”3 In some hypocephali, the ancient Egyptians themselves
simply identified this figure as, variously, “the great god” (nTr aA), the
“Lord of Life” (nb anx), or the “Lord of All” (nb r Dr).4 This first epithet is
significant for Joseph Smith’s interpretation, since in one ancient

Egyptian text the divine figure Iaho Sabaoth (Lord of Hosts) is also
afforded the epithet “the Great God” (pA nTr aA).5
Since some Egyptologists have suggested this figure is the god Min or
Amun, who was often syncretized with Min,6 it would be worth exploring
what we know about this deity, even if this identification wasn’t explicitly
made by the ancient Egyptians themselves. One of Egypt’s oldest gods,
Min was worshipped as early as the Pre-Dynastic Period (pre-3000 BC).
Although he assumed multiple attributes over millennia,7 Min is perhaps best known as “the god of the regenerative, procreative forces of
nature”8—that is, as a sort of fertility god who was often depicted as the
premier manifestation of “male sexual potency.”9 He is frequently shown
raising his arm to the square while holding a flail (symbols or gestures
associated with kingship), displaying power and the ability to protect
from enemies.10
Min is also very often, though not always,11 depicted in hypocephali
with an erect phallus (ithyphallic), which Egyptologists have interpreted
as either a symbol of, on the one hand, sexual potency, fertility, (pro)
creation, and rejuvenation, or, on the other hand, aggression, power, and
authority.12 One Egyptologist has also interpreted depictions of Min
with his raised arm and erect phallus as a sign of him being “a protector

of the temple” whose role was “to repulse negative influences from the
‘profane surroundings’” of the sacred space of the temple.13
That Min would assume the roles of divine procreator who gives life
and divine king who upholds the cosmos is understandable from the
viewpoint of ancient Egyptian religion.14 As Ian Shaw explains,
Although Egyptian art shied away from depicting the sexual act, it had
no such qualms about the depiction of the erect phallus. . . . The three
oldest colossal religious statues in Egyptian history, found by [William
Flinders] Petrie in the earliest strata of the temple of Min at Koptos . . .
were essentially large ithyphallic representations, probably of Min. . . .
This celebration of the phallus appears to be directly related to the Egyptians’ concerns with the creation (and sustaining) of the universe, in
which the king was thought to play a significant role—which was no
doubt one of the reasons why the Egyptian state would have been concerned to ensure that the ithyphallic figures continued to be important
elements of many cults.15
Christina Riggs similarly comments that “near-naked goddesses,
gods with erections, and cults for virile animals, like bulls, make sense in
[ancient Egyptian] religious imagery because they captured the miracle
of life creating new life.”16 For this reason Min was “regarded as the creator god par excellence” in ancient Egypt, as fertility and (male) sexuality
was “subsumed under the general notion of creativity.”17
Figure 7 in Facsimile 2 was either originally drawn or copied somewhat crudely (without access to the original hypocephalus it is impossible to tell), and so it is not entirely clear if the seated figure is ithyphallic

or if he has one arm at his side with the other arm clearly raised in the air.
Although Egyptologists have tended to interpret figure 7 in Facsimile 2
as ithyphallic—and that seems to be how it is depicted—it should be kept
in mind, as noted above, that Min is not always depicted as such in hypocephali, so he need not necessarily be viewed as ithyphallic in Facsimile 2.
But what about the figure assumed to be Nehebkau offering Min
the wedjat-eye?18 Depicted most commonly as a snake or snake-headed
man19—but sometimes as a falcon (as in Facsimile 2)20—in chapter 125
of the Book of the Dead, Nehebkau is named as one of the judges of the
dead.21 In chapter 149 of the Book of the Dead, he is associated with Min
and other deities as one who ensures that the dead will be rejuvenated and
resurrected with a perfected body.22 In the Pyramid Texts, he feeds the
deceased king and acts as a divine messenger.23 As such, he “was considered to be a provider of life and nourishment.”24 Together “Nehebkau and
Min were symbolic of life-force and procreative forces of nature.”25
In ancient Egyptian, the word wDA carries the meaning of “hale, uninjured,” and also “well-being.”26 It can describe the health or wholeness
of the physical body, the soul, or moral character.27 At the time of the
creation of the Joseph Smith hypocephalus, the word meant “whole or
complete” and “perfect,” and featured in ritual contexts where an individual’s heart was proclaimed to be wDA when the words of the ritual
were “spoken exactly” (meaning the ritual was properly executed).28

The wedjat-eye Nehebkau presents to Min (or vice-versa in some hypocephali) was thus envisioned by the ancient Egyptians as the “whole” or
“sound” eye of the god Horus and had an apotropaic function in ancient
Egyptian religion.29 In Ptolemaic temple inscriptions, the word is used
for the purpose of “saving and protecting . . . the body, or being saved in
the temple,”30 and in one Demotic creation text the phrase di wDA denotes
“something the creator god does to the gods while eternally rejuvenating
them, a usage reflected in prayers for mortal individuals.” Accordingly, it
appears in the temple graffiti of petitioners requesting divine blessings.31
The wedjat-eye was, in short, “the symbol of all good gifts”32 and divine
blessings, and thus a symbol for “the miracle of [the] restoration” and
renewal of the body.33 Among Coptic Christians, the word wDA (ⲟⲩⲇⲁⲓ̈)
meant “salvation, saved” in the soteriological sense in addition to the
mundane sense of “healthy, whole.”34 This fuller understanding helps
make sense of Joseph Smith’s interpretation of this figure and situates
such in an ancient Egyptian context.35

Facsimile 3: Judgment Scene or
Presentation Scene?
Facsimile 3 of the Book of Abraham has been identified in the past
as “a constantly recurring scene in Egyptian literature, best known
from the 125th chapter of the Book of the Dead. It represents the judgment of the dead before the throne of Osiris.”1 Based on comparable
iconography from other Egyptian funerary texts, this understanding of
Facsimile 3 has been prevalent among Egyptologists.2 “The formal judgment of the dead contained in BD spell 125 . . . involves the deceased
supplicant making a ‘negative confession’ asserting his or her faultless
behavior on earth in the presence of forty-two gods assembled in the
Hall of the Two Truths, while the heart is weighted against the feather of
Maat.”3 This judgment scene very frequently is depicted as transpiring
before the presence of the god Osiris, who is often shown sitting on a
throne accompanied by his sisters/wives Isis and Nephthys.

Facsimile 3: Judgment Scene or Presentation Scene? 265
Although this interpretation of Facsimile 3 has become commonplace, objections might nevertheless be raised.4 “The problems with the
theory that Facsimile 3 is the vignette from Book of the Dead 125 can
be most readily shown” by the fact that many of the essential elements
needed for a judgment scene are missing in Facsimile 3.5 One copy of the
Book of the Dead from the first century AD—broadly contemporaneous to the Joseph Smith Papyri6—describes what appears to have been
considered the “normative” version of a judgment scene for that time
period:
The forty-two gods [in front of] the deceased above the hall of the truths;
a figure of Hathor, [lady] of the underworld carrying a was-scepter, protecting the man, while the two arms of the scale are straight and Thoth is
on its left, to the right of its [. . .] while Horus speaks, and Anubis grasps
it on the side on which are the two truths (Maats) while he is opposite
on the other side of the scale. Thoth reads the writings since a scroll is
in his hand [. . . Ammut] in whose hand is a knife and before whom are
a sword and a scepter, Anubis holding his hand. A lotus with two supports on which are the four sons of Horus. A chapel in which Osiris sits
on his throne there being an offering table with a lotus before him. Isis is

side of the nonexistent scale. Horus is missing. The figure generally

identified with Anubis is not grasping the side of the scale, but the waist
of the man. Since Thoth is not depicted, he cannot be shown reading
anything. Ammut is absent, along with the knife, sword, and scepter. The
lotus is missing the four sons of Horus atop it. Though Osiris is shown
sitting, he is not depicted seated within any chapel. Almost all of the
elements which the Egyptians thought were important for the scene are
conspicuous by their absence from Facsimile 3. Significantly, these elements are present in a vignette accompanying Book of the Dead, chapter 125, found among the Joseph Smith Papyri, as well as other copies of
vignettes of Book of the Dead, chapter125. These elements are present in
all the judgment scenes that the critics would compare with the Facsimile 3. The elements of the judgment scene as listed in the Demotic Book
of the Dead are consistent with those of earlier judgment scenes. Their
absence from Facsimile 3 indicates that Facsimile 3 is not a judgment
scene and is not directly associated with Book of the Dead 125.8
While it is true that not all ancient Egyptian judgment scenes in the
centuries-long tradition of the Book of the Dead are universally consistent in what they visually depict, when enough elements are missing it
might be reasonably asked whether the illustration in question is in fact
a judgment scene at all. Furthermore, the fact that Facsimile 3 was part of
the Book of Breathings and not the Book of the Dead also raises the question of whether comparing it to chapter 125 from the Book of the Dead
is the right approach in the first place. It is partly for these reasons that
Quinten Barney has recently performed a study of Facsimile 3 in which
he compared it with similar throne scenes depicting the god Osiris from
the other extant copies of the Book of Breathings.9 Barney categorized
four types of throne scenes (invocation, weighing of the heart, presentation, and hybrid) from the Book of Breathings and compared them
with Facsimile 3.10 After careful comparison, Barney concluded that
while “Facsimile No. 3 does have much in common with those various
throne scenes found in these texts, including those scenes from the Book
of Breathings, . . . several challenges present themselves as we begin to try
classifying the Facsimile into one of the four categories of throne scenes
presented above.”11

Facsimile 3: Judgment Scene or Presentation Scene? 267
In fact, when compared with other throne scenes from the Book of
Breathings, Facsimile 3 contains several anomalous artistic elements
that are not standard in other illustrations, and its placement on the
papyrus scroll obtained by Joseph Smith (not at the commencement of
the text but at least two columns in) is likewise not standard for this type
of text. So, while “the type of scene with which Facsimile No. 3 compares
best is that of the Presentation scene, which features the deceased being
introduced into the presence of Osiris by one or more other Egyptian
deities. . . . There are several challenges with placing Facsimile No. 3 into
this category.”12
If Facsimile 3 is indeed closer to a presentation scene than a judgment scene, then it might have a plausible connection with astronomy.
“Parallel scenes on Egyptian temples are explicitly labeled as initiations.
Known initiation rituals from Greco-Roman Egypt include instruction
in astronomy as part of the initiation.”13 This converges with Joseph
Smith’s interpretation that this scene depicts Abraham “reasoning upon
the principles of Astronomy, in the king’s court.” Until further work can
shed more light on this fascinating but complex matter, we will have to
be content for now that “although Facsimile No. 3 was attached to the
Hor Book of Breathings, it is anything but a common funerary scene from
that collection of texts.”14

Abraham and Osiris
(Facsimile 3, Figure 1)
Figure 1 of Facsimile 3 of the book of Abraham was interpreted by Joseph
Smith as “Abraham sitting upon Pharaoh’s throne, by the politeness
of the king, with a crown upon his head, representing the Priesthood,
as emblematical of the grand Presidency in Heaven; with the scepter of
justice and judgment in his hand.” This interpretation has clashed with
those offered by Egyptologists, who have instead identified the figure as
the god Osiris.1 What’s more, two Egyptologists have claimed to arrive at
this interpretation from reading the hieroglyphs to the right of figure 1.2

Abraham and Osiris (Facsimile 3, Figure 1) 271
For example, some of the glyphs in the name of Osiris in the first
column on the right only bear general resemblance to attested spellings
of Osiris’s name in other copies of the Book of Breathings, and other
glyphs that make up the rest of the name and epithets for Osiris look
quite different as well.4 “These issues combine to suggest that the translation of the characters may not be as straightforward as has been previously assumed,”5 so “while one can see good reasons for . . . the use
of parallel texts” to reconstruct illegible characters in Facsimile 3, it is
also necessary to be aware of difficulties or uncertainties in reading the
hieroglyphs in Hedlock’s copy of Facsimile 3.6
Nevertheless, the identity of this figure as Osiris appears reasonable
based on comparable iconography. One might therefore rightly ask how

or even if it is possible to reconcile Joseph Smith’s identification of this
figure as Abraham.
In 1981, Latter-day Saint scholar Blake T. Ostler drew attention to
possible Egyptian connections between the figures of Osiris and Abraham.7 In his study, Ostler cited the work of an earlier non–Latter-day
Saint German scholar drawing parallels between the parable of Lazarus
and the rich man in Luke 16:19–31 and an Egyptian text known as the
tale of Setne.8 As summarized more recently by another Latter-day Saint
scholar, in the Egyptian text, a boy named Si-Osiris (“son of Osiris”)
and his father witness “two funerals: first, that of a rich man, shrouded
in fine linen, loudly lamented and abundantly honored; then, that of a
poor man, wrapped in a straw mat, unaccompanied and unmourned.
The father says that he would rather have the lot of the rich man than
that of the pauper.”9 To show his father the folly of his thinking, SiOsiris takes him to the underworld, where the rich man who had an
elaborate funeral is punished while the pauper who had no dignified
burial is glorified and exalted in the presence of the god Osiris himself.
“The reason for this disparate treatment is that, at the judgment, the
good deeds of the pauper outweighed the bad, but with the rich man
the opposite was true.”10
Some scholars have argued for a Jewish borrowing and adaptation
of the tale of Setne that made its way into the Gospel of Luke. Egyptologist Miriam Lichtheim introduces her translation of the tale of Setne by
commenting on the “genuinely Egyptian motifs” of the nobleman who
is tortured in the netherworld while the poor man is deified in the afterlife. These motifs, she insists, “formed the basis for the parable of Jesus
in Luke 16:19–31, and for the related Jewish legends, preserved in many
variants in Talmudic and medieval Jewish sources.”11

Another scholar has further explored the parallels between these two
traditions and notes how Lazarus being exalted in “the bosom of Abraham” in Luke’s retelling of the parable is very likely a Jewish refashioning
of the imagery in the tale of Setne of the poor beggar being found exalted
by the throne of Osiris. In his words, “‘Abraham’ must be a Jewish substitute for the pagan god Osiris. . . . He is the very seat of divine authority”
in the parable, “for he was originally the lord of Amnte, Osiris.”12 Even
the name Lazarus is likely the Greek rendering of the Hebrew-Aramaic
“God-helped-(him),” which “points back toward an Egyptian original
with similar meaning: ‘Osiris-helps-him’, for instance.”13 As explained by
Kevin Barney, “We are able to see how the Egyptian story has been transformed in Semitic dress. . . . The ‘bosom of Abraham’ [from the Lucan
parable] represents Amnte, the Egyptian abode of the dead. And, most
remarkably, Abraham is a Jewish substitute for the pagan god Osiris—
just as is the case in Facsimiles 1 and 3.”14
There appears to be another instance of the biblical figure Abraham
anciently being associated with the Egyptian god Osiris. An Egyptian
funerary formula found in several sources was later syncretized with
Jewish figures in its later renderings into Greek and Coptic. The short
Demotic version of the formula reads: “May his soul live in the presence of Osiris-Sokar, the great god, lord of Abydos.” In Greek this formula was rendered as “rest his soul in the bosom of Abraham and Isaac
and Jacob.” In this reformulation, “the expression ‘live in the presence of
Osiris’ has been replaced by the expression ‘rest in Abraham’s bosom.’”15
We cannot know exactly why Abraham was viewed by some anciently
as a substitute for the Egyptian god Osiris.16 Whatever the case, “there

16. It should be noted that the ancient association between Abraham and Osiris is
not the only attested instance of Judeo-Egyptian syncretization. As Gary Rendsburg has
pointed out, “the biblical writer utilized the venerable Horus myth in order to present
Moses as the equal to Pharaoh.” As seen in many parallels between the two figures, “the
young Moses [in the biblical account] is akin to the young Horus, the latter a mythic
equal of the living Pharaoh.” Gary A. Rendsburg, “Moses as Equal to Pharaoh,” in Text,
Abraham and Osiris (Facsimile 3, Figure 1) 275
are enough instances where Abraham appears in contexts normally
occupied by Osiris that we must conclude the Egyptians saw some sort of
connection.”17 It is especially noteworthy, as seen above, that Abraham
appears as a substitute for Osiris in ways associated with the judgment of
the dead or a postmortem declaration of the deceased’s worthiness. This
in turn might shed some light on what might otherwise appear as Joseph
Smith’s incongruous interpretation of this figure in Facsimile 3.

Isis the Pharaoh
(Facsimile 3, Figure 2)
The explanation given for Facsimile 3 identifies figure 2 as “King Pharaoh, whose name is given in the characters above his head.” One
potential way to identify this figure by Egyptological methods would be
to read “the characters [hieroglyphs] above his head.” Unfortunately, the
original illustration or vignette from the papyrus is not extant, and so we
are forced to decipher the glyphs as they are reproduced in Facsimile 3
by their engraver Reuben Hedlock. While Hedlock appears to have done
a fairly commendable job accurately reproducing the facsimiles (at least
based on a comparison of Facsimile 1 with the extant original papyrus),
he also made some noticeable mistakes.1 So the first issue at hand in
resolving the question of the identity of this figure would be to determine how legible these glyphs actually are.
In fact, a number of Egyptologists who have examined Facsimile 3
have lamented that the hieroglyphs reproduced by Hedlock were partially or entirely illegible,2 “leaving them to rely upon comparable scenes
from other texts to provide their interpretations of the figures.”3 The only

whereas in the original illustration figure 3 is positioned between figures 2 and 4.
2. Thus, William Flinders Petrie, “The inscriptions are far too badly copied to be able
to read them,” and John Peters, “The hieroglyphics which should describe the scenes,
however, are merely illegible scratches, the imitator not having the skill or intelligence to

Ritner does not provide a hieroglyphic transcription for his reading,
while Rhodes does. A careful comparison of the glyphs as reproduced
by Hedlock and Rhodes, however, reveals some difficulties.5 The most
noticeable difference is in the top three glyphs, which form the name Isis.
These glyphs were either poorly preserved by Hedlock or poorly drawn
by the original ancient Egyptian scribe (it is impossible to tell without
the original papyrus fragment), making them effectively illegible. What
Egyptologists such as Rhodes (and, it would appear, Ritner) have done is
reconstruct and read these glyphs how they think they ought to be read (as
the name of Isis), as opposed to how they actually stand in the preserved
facsimile.6 So while this figure could with good reason be identified as Isis

based on similar iconographic elements found in comparable scenes,7 the
identity of this figure cannot be securely reached based solely on reading
the poorly preserved hieroglyphs. The identification of this figure as Isis is
therefore worth exploring, but there are reasons for this identification to
be accepted cautiously.
At first glance, this appears problematic for Joseph Smith’s interpretation of this figure, since, as seen above, scholars identify this figure as the
goddess Isis (or sometimes the goddess Hathor, who was often syncretized with Isis8), not the Egyptian Pharaoh. If we assume that this identification is correct, a closer look at the attributes and epithets ascribed to
the goddess Isis during the time Facsimile 3 was drawn reveals that this
identification actually has some justification.
As the mother of the god Horus, who was the godly manifestation
of Pharaoh, Isis had long been recognized as the royal mother and the
king’s wife by the ancient Egyptians. “She was most commonly shown as
a woman wearing the throne symbol that helps to write her name. As the
‘throne goddess,’ she was the mother of each Egyptian king.”9 By virtue of
her royal associations and because of her extensive worship throughout
the Mediterranean world,10 by the time of the Joseph Smith Papyri, Isis
had come to be identified as the Pharaohess11 of Egypt. In one text from
this time period, for example, she is called “the Pharaohess of the whole
land” (pr-aAt nt tA r-Dr=f).12 Of her additional dozens of epithets and titles,
she was also designated, among other things, “ruler of the two lands in
the house of joy” (HqAt tAwy m Hwt Awt-ib),13 “ruler of gods and goddesses”
(HqAt nTrw nTrwt),14 “the Pharaoh(ess) of everything” (pr-aAt nt tm nb),15

Epithets such as these were routinely given to the reigning monarch,
whether male or female, and inasmuch as Isis’s name in Egyptian literally
means “throne” or “seat,” her shared identity with the office of the pharaoh is not at all surprising. “As the presumed embodiment of the ‘seat
of the throne,’ [Isis] is in a special way bound to kingship and thus to the
political aspect of [the king’s] divine nature; her role as mother of Horus
and sister-wife of Osiris binds her even more closely into the Egyptian
kingship, in which the living King Horus [the Pharaoh] embodies.”22
Accordingly, “with the idea of the Great Lady [Isis] actually” personifying the throne, and thereby the Egyptian kingship, “the incongruity of
[Joseph Smith’s identification of] figure 2 [in Facsimile 3] as ‘King Pharaoh’ begins to dissolve.”23

Shulem, One of the King’s Principal Waiters
(Facsimile 3, Figure 5)
Figure 5 in Facsimile 3 of the Book of Abraham is identified as “Shulem,
one of the king’s principal waiters.” We don’t know anything more
about the man Shulem beyond this brief description because he does
not appear in the text of the Book of Abraham. Presumably, if we had
more of the story, we would know more about how he fit in the overall
Abrahamic narrative. However, there are some things we can say about
Shulem and his title “the king’s principal waiter.”
First is Shulem’s name. This name is “widely attested in Semitic languages” from the time of Abraham.1 This includes attestations in Old
Akkadian, Old Assyrian, Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian, Eblaite,
and Ugaritic.2 Additionally, Shulem’s title “the king’s principal waiter”
is arguably attested in ancient Egypt. In particular, the title “butler of the
ruler” (wdpw n HqA) is a fairly close match to “the king’s principal waiter”
and is attested during the time of Abraham.3
But what would a Semite like Shulem be doing in the royal court of
Egypt, as depicted in Facsimile 3? In fact, there is evidence of Asiatic migration into Egypt during the time of Abraham. “A number of Asiatics residing in Egypt are also observed in texts dating to [the time of Abraham],”
observes one scholar. “They list Asiatic retainers, dancers, singers, and
other workers. . . . They further point to the presence of institutions for
the coordination of relations between Asiatics and the local population.
As some Asiatics bear Semitic names, it is likely that Levantines were still
migrating into Egypt at this time.”4 After Abraham’s day, “in the Rammeside

period a number of Canaanites rose to prominence in the Egyptian palace
administration, and the position of ‘royal butler’ was a popular career path
in this respect.”5 It could be that Shulem is at least one instance of this trend
predating the later Rammeside period.
In fact, the Egyptian “Fourteenth Dynasty was ‘a local dynasty of Asiatic origin in the north-eastern Delta’ who are notable as ‘kings with
foreign, mostly West Semitic, names.’”6 Once again, not only the names
of the rulers but also members of elite households show signs of Semitic
origin during this time.7 “So from Shulem’s name and title . . . we can
surmise the following: From the form of his name, [it would appear]
that Shulem lived during the late Middle Kingdom or the Second Intermediate Period [ca. 1800–1600 BC]. Shulem was [likely] not a native
Egyptian. He was probably a first generation immigrant. He [likely]
served in the court of a Fourteenth Dynasty ruler, who was probably not
a native Egyptian either.”8 This evidence reinforces the overall historical
plausibility of the Book of Abraham and may help make sense of Joseph
Smith’s identification of this figure in Facsimile 3.

Conclusion
Ask the Right Questions and Keep Looking
As the preceding has shown, the Book of Abraham is an inexhaustible source of exploration and critical investigation, and the work of
scholarly examination into this book shows no signs of slowing. On the
contrary, we see multiple welcoming avenues for additional study. The
net result of this review, in the meantime, has been the (re)discovery
of numerous points of convergence between the Book of Abraham and
the ancient world and theological and narrative aspects of the book that
invite more sustained investigation. We hope that our guide has been
helpful in orienting readers on these and related matters pertaining to
the Book of Abraham and that it suggests some ways in which we might
make progress.
There is still much that we do not know when it comes to how precisely Joseph Smith translated the Book of Abraham. The Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints itself takes no official position on this
point other than to affirm that the translation was accomplished by the
gift and power of God (something we, the authors, also affirm). There
are also remaining questions surrounding Joseph Smith’s explanations
of the facsimiles and the ancient world of Abraham. This guide does not
presume to answer all the questions people have had or may yet have
about the Book of Abraham, its contents, and the manner of its translation. We freely acknowledge that the tools of scholarship at this time do
not confirm every claim made in or about the Book of Abraham, and we
emphasize that the various lines of evidence explored in this treatment
do not somehow “prove” the Book of Abraham is true. We are, of course,
well aware of the controversy that still surrounds the Book of Abraham,
and we do not presume that this offering has once and for all settled
the debate. But what we have seen nevertheless does help us plausibly
situate the Book of Abraham in the ancient environment from whence
284 BYU Studies Quarterly
it purports to derive, informs how we might approach the text going
forward, and positively affects our evaluation of Joseph Smith’s claims to
prophetic inspiration. Just as intellectual honesty demands we acknowledge the remaining gaps in our understanding and the ways in which
the Book of Abraham still lacks verification based on available evidence,
so too does it demand that this positive evidence not be overlooked,
ignored, dismissed out of hand, or downplayed, even if it is inconvenient
for certain worldviews and ideological commitments.
Although it should be evident that we tend to favor certain theories
over others when it comes to explaining the nature and translation of
the Book of Abraham, we do not presume to impose our understanding on others as an article of faith. We are happy to acknowledge that
Latter-day Saints can in good faith come to different conclusions about
the nature of this book of scripture and “pursue a faithful study of the
Book of Abraham from different backgrounds and approaches.”1 In fact,
we welcome these different approaches and encourage a multitude of
voices to contribute to the conversation.
We also cheerfully embrace what Hugh Nibley articulated some time
ago as an important strategy for any careful reader of the Book of Abraham. As Nibley so memorably expressed it, the key to approaching the
Book of Abraham, or any other scriptural work, for that matter, is to
ask the right questions and keep looking.2 Future discoveries may bolster, qualify, or even undermine some of the points we have raised in
this volume. This special issue of BYU Studies Quarterly, like every other
work of scholarship, has a shelf life and will one day need updating or
replacement. But this we welcome, because we are confident that future
generations of disciple-scholars asking the right questions and answering those questions with the best available evidence will provide an even
better case for the Book of Abraham than what we have offered at this
time with what we currently know.

Instruction to Authors
BYU Studies publishes scholarship that is informed by the restored gospel of Jesus
Christ. Submissions are invited from all scholars who seek truth “by study and also by
faith” (D&C 88:118), discern the harmony between revelation and research, value both
academic and spiritual inquiry, and recognize that knowledge without charity is nothing (1 Cor. 13:2).
BYU Studies Quarterly features learned perspectives relevant to Latter-day Saints.
Contributions from all disciplines are invited. Personal essays, short studies, poetry, art,
and significant historical documents are welcomed.
To be accepted for publication, a submission must clearly communicate all of the
following:
• It is informed by the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.
• The author knows and clearly conveys what is at stake.
• The submission contributes new knowledge or insight.
• It is accessible to educated nonspecialists.
Submissions are considered by the editor in chief and staff editors. If the submission
merits further review, it is considered by one or more members of the editorial board, which
is composed of scholars from a wide range of disciplines. Together they determine whether
the submission merits peer review. If so, well-informed and responsive scholars provide
reviews on which acceptance or rejection is based. This process takes three months or less.
BYU Studies rarely considers work that has been previously published (including on
the Internet), is under consideration elsewhere, or that may be the property of another
publisher.
