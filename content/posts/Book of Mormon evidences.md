In 1879, Emma Smith said,
“Joseph Smith could neither write nor dictate a coherent and well-worded letter, let alone dictate a book like the Book of Mormon.  I am satisfied that no man could have dictated the writing of the manuscripts unless he was inspired; for, when acting as his scribe, he would dictate to me hour after hour; and when returning after meals, or after interruptions, he could at once begin where he had left off.  This was a usual thing for him to do.  It would have been improbable that a learned man could do this; and, for one so ignorant and unlearned as he was, it was simply impossible.”
Here is a letter written by Joseph Smith
My Father Joseph Smith Siegnior moved to Palmyra Ontario County in the State of New York and being in indigent circumstances were obliged to labour hard for the support of a large Family having nine chilldren and as it required the exertions of all that were able to render any assistance for the support of the Family therefore we were deprived of the bennifit of an education suffice it to say I was mearly instructtid in reading writing and the ground of Arithmatic which constuted my whole lierary acquirements.”
This letter clearly has multiple typos and is not a production of a well versed writer. The Book of Mormon, however, is clearly the product of a sophisticated, educated, experienced writer. 
The Book of Mormon has over 600 geographical references and virtually every city, land, body of water, hill, or region maintains a consistent spatial relationship with other geographical features. 
Another example is the lengthy genealogical record found in Ether. Chapter 1 lists 30 kings beginning with Ether, ending with Jared. The rest of the book precisely chronicles the reigns of those kings in reverse order. 
Keeping track of all the plates, through the transmission through prophets, is another complex task, but everything proves consistent and purposefully put together. 
Alma 11 contains a developed system of weights and measures, which has parallels to ancient Mesopotamian and Egyptian systems. And its units of exchange are practical. 
One of the most impressive elements is the quantity or variety of Hebraisms, features typical of ancient Hebrew culture. The entire chapter of Alma 36 is a chiasmus. In Alma 42 is something called gradation repeats each successive concept to create a unity of ideas and build up to a climactic conclusion. At least 50 types of Hebraisms. Many of them showing up in the 100s. 
Some have even compared the Book of Mormon to Lord of the Rings, but Tolkien was an English professor who spent decades researching and developing the geography and characters of the Lord of the Rings, while Joseph Smith was an uneducation farmer only a couple months of education. In no more than 74 working days, without any notes, without any revisions, without visibility of the manuscript, and without relying on scribes to know where he left off. 
The claim that Joseph Smith produced the Book of Mormon purely by his own work and without divine inspiration is completely untenable. There is no possible way he could have produced such a masterpiece with the education he had in the time he did. 
In so thankful that Jesus Christ is willing to reveal his teachings and evidence to us in the latter days. Jesus Christ is omniscient and omnipotent. He has given the world sufficient evidence that he exists and is our savior. He is our personal savior and through reading some of the Book of Mormon I have learned that. 
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
