# Temple Garment

After Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden, they were cast down to earth and fell and found themselves naked. 
> 7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.

Genesis 3:21
> 21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
