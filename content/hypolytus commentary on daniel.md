~Hippolytus Commentary on Daniel 2.19.4
Hippolytus’ Commentary on Daniel is the oldest
surviving Christian commentary on Scripture. It was
composed by Hippolytus of Rome most likely between 202
and 211 AD, a time of great persecution. This is the first
complete English translation.
Hippolytus seems to have undertaken this
commentary to comfort his fellow Christians, who, like
Daniel and his three companions, suffered for their faith.
For Hippolytus, suffering was not something to fear, but
something to be gladly embraced. In his commentary he
beseeches Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, “Tell me, you
three boys, remember me, I entreat you, that I also may obtain
the same lot of martyrdom with you.”1
 His request was
fulfilled; Hippolytus suffered martyrdom in 235 AD after
being exiled to Sardinia.
Hippolytus also tries to provide assurance about what
is expected in the end times when Christ returns. While
interpreting the visions in the book of Daniel, he makes some
prophetic predictions of his own; for example, when
interpreting the dream of Nebuchadnezzar he says that after
the empire of the Romans, “democracies are shown.”2
Additionally Hippolytus gives information on Peter’s
and Paul’s deaths, Paul’s encounter with a lion, a short
conversation between Judas and Jesus, the birthday of Christ
(which he claims is December 25th), and he also provides
insight into early Christian eschatology and allegory as well as
canonical issues involving apocryphal parts of the book of
Daniel. Of course there are many other pertinent issues

present in Hippolytus’ Commentary on Daniel which cannot be
discussed here, but these are now easily investigated in
English.
To translate this text I read through the Greek text of
Marcel Richard’s GCS series Kommentar zu Daniel four times
and made a rigid and literal translation. Afterwards I went
through and softened up the translation to better accord with
English grammar and style. The text will still strike many as
quite rigid, but this could not easily be avoided unless I
reworked the whole volume. Words that are in italics are not
present in the Greek but are usually implied and are added for
clarity.
Scripture quotations are cited in the footnotes as
accurately as possible, however Hippolytus does sometimes
mix several verses together and the verse numberings of the
Greek translation of the Old Testament can be slightly
different from the Hebrew, so there are occasional
differences between the citations and our English Bibles.
Hippolytus also includes Susannah, the Song of the Three
Children, and Bel and the Dragon as part of the canonical text of
the book of Daniel. These are cited as separate works in the
footnotes. Gaps in the Greek text are shown with an ellipsis
and a footnote that simply says, “Lacuna.”
The Greek text is quoted in the footnotes when I
thought the text was particularly interesting. Some passages
are ambiguous and I attempted to preserve this in the
translation; at times I cite the Greek text when the translation
was also difficult. Hippolytus cites some verses frequently,
but occasionally with differences in the Greek wording, which
I attempted to preserve in the translation. Underlined
subtitles are not part of the original text but are placed as a
guide for the reader.
At the end of the translation I have included an
extensive appendix about the authenticity of Hippolytus’

claim that Jesus was born on December 25th and one smaller
appendix about Clement of Alexandria’s dating of Jesus’
birth.
As an amateur, working alone with few resources and
limited time, I have done my best, but there is no doubt that I
have made mistakes. I believe, however, that most of my
errors are likely editorial mistakes of English spelling,
grammar, and formatting and citation errors; I have given all
my effort to ensure that the translation itself is faithful.

Book 1
Concerning Susannah and Daniel
Hippolytus discusses his purpose behind his
commentary
1.1. Wishing to precisely demonstrate1
 the times of the
captivity which befell the sons of Israel and the prophetic
dreams2
 of the blessed Daniel, and also the manner of his life
from childhood3
 in Babylon, I myself come forward to speak
in order to testify to the holy and righteous prophetic man,
even to him who became a witness4
 of Christ, who not only
then in those times, revealed the visions of king
Nebuchadnezzar, but also similarly, having thoroughly taught
his youths5
, led the faithful witnesses6
 onward into the world.
1.2. Now this occurred during the kingdom of Jehoiakim
the son of Josiah, according to the times of the prophecy of
the blessed Jeremiah, who…7
together with the rest of the
captives was captured and brought with them into Babylon.
1.3. And Daniel8
, being a young boy, refuted the decrepit
elders who were engaged in wicked desires9
, demonstrating in
in this the heavenly judge, who, though being a youth of
twelve years, was destined to refute the elders who were
transgressors of the law in the temple.

1.4. And so this well known account1
 occurred long ago in
in Babylon under the lawless elders, the judges who,
forgetting the law of God and being enslaved to fleshly lusts,
became plotters against the chaste Susannah, unrighteously
grasping to destroy her righteous blood. 1.5. Accordingly it
was necessary that these things be fulfilled in this way by the
elders,2
 so that namely the chosen race of righteousness may
be manifested to all and the chastity of the blessed Susannah
may be clearly shown and the righteous and holy prophet
Daniel, then a young prophet, may be demonstrated to the
people.
Hippolytus discusses the historical background to the
Book of Daniel
2.1. Therefore it is necessary for us, while making a proof
of these matters3
, to precisely take up for the persuasion of our
listeners, the things set before us; and we shall not pass over
what captivities4
 befell the people, and what befell some
5
 of the
the kings.6
2.2. For these are the five sons of the blessed Josiah:
Jehoahaz, Eliakim who was also called Jehoiakim, Johanan,
Zedekiah who was also called Jeconiah, and Shallum.7

2.3. And Jehoahaz, after the death of his father, was
anointed by the people into the kingdom, being twenty-three
years old. 2.4. Pharaoh Necho arose against him in the third

month of his kingdom and, taking him prisoner, he brought
him into Egypt. And the Jews1
 set a tribute upon the earth of
one hundred talents of silver and ten talents of gold and
Pharaoh Necho2
 set in his place Eliakim, his brother, as king
of the land, who also changed his name to Jehoiakim. He
reigned for eleven years.
2.5. Then, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon arose
against him and, taking him prisoner, brought him and some
of the vessels of the House of the Lord, which were in
Jerusalem, into Babylon. 2.6. As a friend of Pharaoh he was
imprisoned3
 and the king, having been restored by the next
king of Babylon4
in the thirtieth year, was brought out by Evil
Merodach king of Babylon. And he raised5
 his head and was
his adviser and ate with him at his table until the day in which
he died.
3.1. And so after his deportation his son Jehoiakim6
reigned three years.7
3.2. And so Nebuchadnezzar arose
against him and deported both him and ten thousand men of
the people into Babylon and set in his place Jeconiah the
brother of his father, whom also changed his name to
Zedekiah, with whom he, having made oaths and covenants,
returned to Babylon. 3.3. He, after reigning eleven years,

 Whom we call Jehoiachin, but Hippolytus uses the same spelling as

 Hippolytus is here attempting to harmonize the three dates of
Jehoiakim (Jerhoiachin’s) reign). Which are 3 years (Daniel 1:1), 3
months (2 kings 24:8, 2 Chron. 36:10) and 8 years (2 kings 24:12).
Hippolytus is also assuming that the king in Daniel is the son of
Jehoiakim and not Jehoiakim himself.

withdrew from Nebuchadnezzar1
 and gave himself to
Pharaoh king of Egypt.
3.4. But in the twelfth year, Nebuchadnezzar and all the
power of the Chaldeans came against him and besieged the
city and camped around it and pressed in on it from all sides;
from then on many of them were destroyed by famine, others
killed by the sword, and some of them were taken as captives.
The city was burned in fire and the temple and the wall were
demolished. 3.5. And the power of the Chaldeans took all the
treasures which were found in the House of the Lord and all
the vessels, both the gold and silver and all the copper vessels.
Nebuzaradan the captain cut them out and brought them into
Babylon, and Zedekiah himself, who was also called Jeconiah,
fled through the night with seven-hundred men, but the
powers of the Chaldeans pursued Zedekiah and seized him in
Jericho and brought him to the king of Babylon in Deblatha.2
3.6. And the king and those with him were judged in spirit
because he transgressed the oath of the Lord and the
covenant, which Nebuchadnezzar3
 set before him. 3.7. And
taking his sons, Nebuchadnezzar4
 slaughtered them before
him and he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah who was also called
Jeconiah, and shackled him in iron fetters and brought him
into Babylon and he ground at the mill until the day in which
he died. 3.8. And when he died they took his body and hurled
it behind the wall of Nineveh.
3.9. At this the prophecy of Jeremiah the prophet was
fulfilled, who said, “As I live, says the Lord, though Jeconiah,
who is the son of Josiah the king of Judah, is the signet ring
upon my right hand, I will remove you from there and I will
deliver you into the hands of those who seek your life, of
whom you were wary of their face, into the hands of the

Chaldeans. And I will cast you and your mother who bore
you into a land, in which you were not born1
, and there you
will die. But to the land which they pray for in their souls,
they will certainly not return. Jeconiah is dishonored as a
useless vessel which is not needed, on account of this he is
cast out and banished to a land which he does not know. O
Land, land! Hear the word of the Lord! Mark this man as an
exiled man, because in truth he is not worthy to have one from
his seed grow to sit upon the throne of David, a ruler still in
Judah2
.”3
4.1. And so after all of the people were deported and both
the city was deserted and the Most Holy Place destroyed, in
order to fulfill the word of the Lord, which he spoke through
the mouth of Jeremiah the prophet, “The Most Holy Place
will be deserted seventy years,”4
 we find the blessed Daniel in
Babylon as a prophet5
 and as6
 an avenger7
 of Susannah.
5.1. For Scripture says, “And there was a man living in
Babylon and the name for him was Jehoiakim and he took a
wife, whose name was Susannah, daughter of Hilkiah, who was
exceedingly beautiful and who feared the Lord, and her
parents were righteous and taught their daughter according to
the Law of Moses.”8
5.2. And so this account occurs later, but it is written
before as the beginning of the book.9

of the scribes to place many things in reverted order in the
Scriptures. 5.3. For we also find in the prophetic visions that
some visions which occurred first are even fulfilled at the end,
and in turn again what is spoken last occurs even first. 5.4.
This happens by the economy of the Spirit, so that the devil
may not understand what was spoken by the prophets in
parables and then, having ensnared a man again a second
time, kill him.
Daniel and his companions are chosen by the king
6.1. This is the beginning of the book, “In the third year
of the kingdom of Jehoiakim the king of Judah,
Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came into Jerusalem
and blockaded it. And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of
Judah into his hand as well as some of the vessels of the
House of God and he brought them into the land of Shinar,
into the house of his god.”1
6.2. And so Scripture describes these things in this way so
that it may indicate the occurrence of the captivity of the
people, when Jehoiakim, the son of Eliakim who was also
called Jehoiakim2
, was deported and the three youths3
 together
together with Daniel were taken along with him. 6.3. Thus,
Jehoiakim was the husband of Susannah.
7.1. And Scripture says, “And the king told Ashpenaz the
chief of the eunuchs to bring in some of those from the sons of
the captivity of Israel and from the seed of the king and from
the princes,4
 young men, who have no blemish, who are
beautiful in appearance and are understanding in all wisdom,

being well versed in knowledge,1
 disposed to prudence, and
who have in themselves the strength to stand in the house of
the king, and to teach them the letters and the tongue of the
Chaldeans. And the king appointed them on that very day to
be nourished from the table of the king and from the wine
which he drank in order for them to be nourished three years,
and after these things to stand before the king. And there was
among them from the sons of Judah, Daniel and Hanniah,
Mishael, and Azariah.2
”

7.2. It is necessary that those who love learning to not
read these things cursorily, but to prepare4
 the mind for the
things that lie before us. For the divine writings do not idly
preach to us, but their admonition is meant for us5
 and also the
blessing of these prophets and the demonstration of all the
things which are spoken by them are for us as well.
7.3. For when Hezekiah king of Judah was sick unto
death, then “Isaiah the prophet came to him and told him
‘Set in order your sons and your daughters and your father’s
house, for you will die and you will not live.’”6
7.4. Having
been grieved at this word, “Hezekiah turned his face to the
wall and prayed to the Lord saying, ‘Lord remember me just
as I have walked before you in truth and in faith and with a
full heart and I have done what is pleasing in your presence.’
And Hezekiah wept with great weeping.”7
7.5. After this
occurred, Isaiah was sent to him a second time and he said to
him, “The Lord the God of David your father says this, ‘I
have heard your prayer and have seen your tears. Behold, I
set before you the days of your life, ten and five years and I

will deliver you from the hand of the king of the Assyrians.
This will be a sign to you from the Lord that the Lord will
bring about this word which he spoke. Behold, I turn back
the shadow on the stairs of the house of your father which
the sun descends upon, the shadow shall descend ten steps so
that there will be in that day thirty two hours.’”1
7.6. For after the sun ran its course and arrived at the tenth
hour and the shadow had descended ten steps of the house of
the temple, then the sun reversed again upon those ten steps
behind it according to the saying of the Lord, and there were
twenty hours in the day. And again the sun having encircled its
own course according to its own path, it went to the west.2

Therefore there were thirty-two hours of daylight.
3
8.1. But perhaps one will say, “This is not possible.” O
man, what is impossible for God? From the beginning did
not he himself design all creation from what was not and set
the measures in creation4
 for illumination of day and night,
and to whom do all things, being in subjection, serve and to
whom does creation5
 tremble at the hearing of his voice? And
so what is impossible for men, these things are possible for
God.6
8.2. But we also have another witness regarding this
demonstration.7
8.3. For when Joshua the son of Nun was
warring with the Amorites, the sun having descended already
to the west and the battle nearly won, the blessed Joshua was

1
 2 Kings 20:9
2
 Or: to its setting
3
 After ten of the twelve hours of daylight had elapsed the sun reversed
ten hours and then went back over the ten hours, making twenty extra
hours and thirty total hours, and then it completed the final two hours,
making thirty-two total hours of daylight.

shrewd lest night come to pass and the foreigners flee, so he
shouted saying, “Stand still sun at Gibeon and moon at the
chasm of Aijalon,1
 as long as I war with this people.”2
 And
the sun and moon stopped in their position and the sun3
 did
not go to set until the end of one day, so that that day was
twenty-four hours of daylight. And on account of this
Scripture testified saying, “There was never a day like that
before when God heeded a man.”4
8.4. And so from the beginning, having fixed the
measures in heaven and having prescribed for these things
perpetual courses according to his own authority, how could
he not also divert and turn and change these things whenever
he should will it to be possible?5
8.5. For before Joshua the
sun stopped at Gibeon and the moon at the chasm of Aijalon
for one day, but before Hezekiah the moon together with the
sun reversed backwards, so that there would not be a
disorderly collision of the two intervals6
of time, which follow
one another. These periods7
of time not only happened before
the Lord, when he suffered, but also the same day and all the
world was shaken.8
9.1. For also then, Berodach9
 the Chaldean, the king of
Babylon, because he practiced the astrological art and
precisely measured out the course of the sun and moon10

learning the cause of the phenomenon, was astounded at what
happened to Hezekiah, and sent letters and gifts to Hezekiah.
9.2. Just as in a similar manner also the Magi1
 did, who
came from the east. For after the Lord was born in
Bethlehem and a star shone in heaven, according to what was
prophesied, the Magi, being astonished at the occurrence of
the sign, came to Jerusalem, saying, “Where is he who has
been born the King of the Jews, for we have seen his star in
the east and have come to worship him.”2
9.3. And so
similarly also the Chaldeans then, not finding the habitual
course of the sun, honored Hezekiah with gifts and letters as
a God fearing and righteous man, having been amazed at the
sign which was given by his God.
9.4. Hezekiah rejoiced at these things and showed the
Chaldeans3
 all the treasures which were in the house of the
Lord; next he showed them all the wealth and his glory. 9.5.
And so afterward, when Isaiah the prophet said “Who are
these men and from where have they come to you?”
Hezekiah answered, “They have come from a far off land to
me, from the land of Babylon.” 9.6. Isaiah said to him, “What
did they see in your house?” And Hezekiah said, “They saw
all the things which are in my house and there is nothing which
I did not show them, but even the things which are in my
treasuries.”
9.7. And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the
Lord, the all powerful Lord of Hosts. ‘Behold, days are
coming’, says the Lord, ‘when even all of the things which are in
your house and as much as your fathers treasured until this
day shall even go into Babylon and not one thing shall be left
behind,’ says the Lord, ‘And from your children, who have

come from you, being begotten by you, they shall be taken
and be eunuchs in the house of the king of Babylon.’”1
10.1. And so therefore what was spoken by the Lord was
fulfilled and the prophet, who spoke truthfully, showed that
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came and took all the
treasures which were found in the house of the Lord and
made the people captives, he also took to himself the sons of
the king and from those who were wellborn of nobility2
 from
boyhood, among whom were also called Daniel, Hanniah,
Mishael and Azariah, whose lineage Scripture passes over in
silence, but it describes their piety and faith and the acts
which occurred there.
10.2. For these, having acquired the fear of God from
boyhood, did not want to partake from the table of the king
nor to drink from the wine which he drank.3
10.3. O blessed
boys, who guarded the covenant of the fathers and did not
transgress the law which was given through Moses, but who
feared God on account of his preaching! 10.4. These captives
who were in a strange land were not beguiled by the many
foods nor enslaved by the pleasure of the wine, nor enticed
by the kingly glory. They who were plundered kept their
mouths undefiled and pure, as a pure word, which comes
forth from a pure mouth, hymns through the mouth4
 to the
heavenly Father, just as it is written, “If you shall bring forth
honor from worthlessness you will be as my mouth.”5
10.5. And so, you know, O man, what has been spoken.
A mouth brings forth the paternal honorable6
 Word from
itself, so that again a second time the Word is shown as being

begotten by the saints, which always begets the saints and

11.1. And so Scripture says, “And Daniel set in his heart
not to be defiled with what was on the table of the king and
with the wine which he drank2
 and he asked the chief eunuch
to give them vegetables”,3
 so that it may be shown that a man
does not live by bread alone.4
11.2. “And God gave Daniel
mercy and favor before the chief eunuch. But the chief
eunuch was saying to them, ‘I myself fear my lord the king
who has marked out your bread and your drink, lest he see
that your face is sullen5
 compared to the other youths at your
assembly and you condemn my head to the king.’”6

and so they
said to him, “Then test your slaves for ten days and give us
vegetables2
 and we shall eat them and drink water and our
appearances shall be seen and you shall see the appearances
of the boys who eat from the table of the king and, just as
you see, in this way do to us.”3
11.5. Do you see the unalterable faith of the youths and
the immutable fear of God? They asked for intervals of time,
ten days, so that in this they may prove that they are not able
to procure grace from God differently from other men, but
only4
by believing the preaching of the word through Jesus.
12.1. And so Scripture says, “And the chief eunuch heard
them and tested them for ten days and after the end of the ten
days their appearances appeared better and stronger5
 in body6
body6
 compared to the boys who ate at the table of the
king.”7
12.2. And so these boys, though nourished with bread
and water alone, were equipped with heavenly wisdom, and
they had grace beyond all the boys their same age.
12.3. “For God gave them understanding and prudence in
all learning and wisdom and Daniel understood all visions
and dreams. And after the end of the days the chief eunuch
brought them before the king and the king spoke with them
and none were found from all of them like Daniel and
Hanniah and Mishael and Azariah.”8
12.4. And so the Word
brought them forth in all wisdom, displaying them as faithful

witnesses in Babylon, so that through them the worship of
the Babylonians might be disgraced and Nebuchadnezzar
might be defeated by the three boys and through their faith
the fire in the furnace might be banished and the blessed
Susannah might be rescued from death and the profane lust
of the lawless Elders might be convicted.
12.5. These four boys, heeding1
 God and having the fear
of God in their hearts, carried out these victories in the city
of Babylon. Therefore, come blessed Daniel, the avenger2
 of
Susannah,3
 so that you may also show us the things that are
destined to occur!4
13.1. For Scripture says, “And there was a man living in
Babylon and the name for him was Jehoiakim and he took a
wife, whose name was Susannah, daughter of Hilkiah, who was
exceedingly beautiful and who feared the Lord.”5
 Concerning
whom we have written in the beginning of this book,6
 who,
being a stranger in Babylon, took Susannah to wife. 13.2. But
she was a daughter of Hilkiah the priest, who found the book
of the law in the house of the Lord, when Josiah the king
ordered him to cleanse the Holy of Holies.
13.3. Her brother was Jeremiah the prophet, who together
with the remaining people,7
 after the captivity of the people in
Babylon occurred, was led away into Egypt and dwelt in
Tahpanhes,8
 and there, while prophesying, was stoned by them
them and was killed. 13.4. And so these people were from the
priestly lineage of the tribe of Levi and they mixed with the

tribe of Judah, so that through the two righteous tribes and
through1
their united seed2
, the righteousness of Christ may be
be shown according to the fleshly seed, and he who was born3
born3
 from them in Bethlehem may be proclaimed King and
Priest of God.
13.5. For also Matthew, wishing to trace4
 the pure and
faultless lineage of Christ, according to the flesh, until Joseph,
coming to Josiah he omits5
 his five sons and names Jeconiah,
who while in Babylon was begotten from Susannah, skipping6
from righteous seed to righteous seed. For he says, “Josiah
begot Jeconiah and his brothers during the deportation to
Babylon.”7
13.6. And so how is this declared? For Josiah,
having reigned in the land of Judah thirty-one years, died
there. And so how is it possible that having died there he
begot Jeconiah in Babylon?
13.7. From this it is necessary to observe that Matthew
traced the genealogy of him who was begotten from
Jehoiakim and from Susanna, as Jeconiah was the son of
Eliakim who was called Jehoiakim the son of Josiah.8
 For
Matthew was not able to trace the genealogy of him who was
banished by the Holy Spirit, as being in the line of this
Jeconiah,9
 as some deceivers maintain. For this cripple,
having been brought into Babylon, and having been shut-up

there at the mill as a prisoner1
, died childless. So that
Scripture does not idly teach us saying, “And there was a man
living in Babylon and the name for him was Jehoiakim and he
took a wife, whose name was Susannah, daughter of Hilkiah,
who was exceedingly beautiful and who feared the Lord.”2
13.8. And so Jeconiah was begotten from her, and
Jeconiah begot Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begot Zerubbabel. He,
together with Ezra the scribe and Jesus3
 the son of Jehozadak,
came up to Jerusalem according to the command of Cyrus
the Persian.4
 And in this way continued the pure lineage of
the fathers until the birth of Jesus Christ.
14.1. Scripture says, “And her parents were righteous and
taught their daughter according to the Law of Moses.”5
 14.2.
For the tree is known from the fruit which it readily brings
forth from itself.6
 For reverent men who are also zealous for
the law bring into the world children worthy of God, who on
the one hand is the prophet and witness of Christ, and on the
other is found chaste and faithful in Babylon, whom is
proclaimed as the devout and chaste blessed Daniel the
prophet.
Susannah is accused by the wicked elders
14.3. Scripture says, “And Jehoiakim was exceedingly
wealthy and there was for him a garden adjoining his house,
and the Jews gathered to him because he was more honorable
than all the others. And in that year two elders were appointed

from the people as judges, concerning whom the Master
spoke, that lawlessness came from Babylon, from ancient
judges1
, who appeared to govern the people. These remained
at the house of Jehoiakim, and all those who had lawsuits
came to them.”2
 And so it is necessary to seek the reason why
this is so. For how are these who are captives and slaves of the
Babylonians able to come together at the house3
 like those who
are autonomous?4
14.5. In this it is necessary to understand that after
Nebuchadnezzar deported them he humanely proclaimed
privileges for them and allowed them to come together to
practice all things according to the law. 14.6. Some, taking
this authority, appointed two chiefs of the people who
appeared to govern the people. These remained at the house
of Jehoiakim, because he was more honorable and wealthier
than all the others, as he was from the royal lineage.
15.1. To this Scripture says, “There was a garden adjoining
his house and it happened as the people departed in the
middle of the day, that Susannah entered and walked around
in the garden of her husband, and the two elders watched her
everyday and became lustful for her.”5
15.2. Therefore the
chiefs of the Jews now want to mutilate these things of the
book of Daniel, claiming that these things did not happen in
Babylon, because they are ashamed at what happened under
the elders at that time,6
and thus they fail to recognize the
administration of the Spirit.

15.3. As the divine writings are not respecters of persons
and with openness display all things, not only the righteous
works of men, which after they did them they were justified,
but also the terrible things which occurred under them, upon
which they…1were disfigured2
, they died, so that those who
have the fear of God imitate the righteous and in this way
partake in righteousness, but those who do the opposite have
before their eyes what is destined for them, vengeance before
the presence of God.
15.4. For that which issued from the elders concerning
what befell Susannah, these things are now also likewise
accomplished by the chiefs of the people in Babylon now.3
15.5.
For Susannah foreshadows the church, Jehoiakim her
husband foreshadows Christ. The garden is the calling of the
saints just like how fruit bearing trees produce fruit in the
church. Babylon is the world. 15.6. But the two elders
represent the example of two peoples who scheme against the
church, one who is of the circumcision and one who is of the
gentiles. For it is said, “They were appointed as chiefs of the
people and judges,”4
 It indicates that in this age they have
authority and rule, unrighteously judging the righteous.
16.1. But that they zealously watched Susannah walking in
the garden every day, this indicates that until now they, who
are both from the Gentiles and the Jews of the circumcision,
watch5
 and interfere in the business of the church, both of
whom wish to bring false testimonies against us, just as the
apostle says, “On account of the secretly introduced false

brethren, who were brought in to spy out the liberty which
we have in Christ Jesus.”1
16.2. And so in this way Scripture says, “And so these
zealously watched every day to see her and they turned away
their minds and perverted their eyes that they might not see
heaven nor remember the righteous judgments.”2
16.3. For
these become plotters and seducers of the church, how then
are they able to judge righteous matters or look up to heaven
with a pure heart, they who have been enslaved from the
beginning of this era3
?
16.4. “And they were both sorely pricked concerning her
and they did not report their grief to one another because
they were ashamed to report their lust and because they
wanted to have intercourse with her.”4For even what is
spoken has truly overtaken them5
, for the two peoples are
sorely pricked by the working6
 of Satan in the two elders7
, they
wish to work persecutions and oppressions against the
church, zealously seeking8
 in such a manner as to utterly
destroy her, yet these themselves are not in agreement with each
other.
16.5. “And one said to the other ‘Let us now go home
because it is the hour of the noon time meal.’ And having
gone out they departed9
 from one another. And after turning
turning back they came to the previous place10.”11 And so to
have separated themselves from one another at the hour of

the noon time meal and to have turned back to the previous
place,1
this indicates that with terrestrial foods the Jews are not
not in harmony with the gentiles2
, but in opinions3
 and in
every other worldly matter, meeting at these things, they
agree.4
16.6. And so Scripture says, “And they asked one another
the reason why they returned, and they acknowledged5
 their
lust.”6
 They prophesied that they themselves are destined to be
be examined by angels in order to give an account to God
because of every sin which they committed, as Solomon says,
“Affliction shall destroy the impious.”7
 For they are caught
by the trial of the wicked.8
17.1.“And it happened, while they watched for a fitting day
when she would go into the garden just as the day before and on
the third day, with only two maidens, she desired to wash in
the garden because it was during the heat of the day9
.”10 17.2.
“And it happened, while they watched for a fitting day.”11

What does Scripture say is fitting, but the day of the Passover
in which the washing in the garden prepares those who burn
in refining fire and the Church, like Susannah, who is washed, is
offered as a pure bride for God?

17.3. And so Scripture says, “She would go into the garden
just as the day before and on the third day, with only two
maidens, she desired to wash in the garden.”1
 It is clear that
whenever the Church, according to custom, longs to receive
the spiritual washing, it is necessary in this to follow two
handmaidens. For the confessing Church receives the
washing through faith unto Christ and through love unto
God… 17.4.…2
and the two handmaidens, as they follow it;
faith and love, prepare the oil and the ointments for the
washings.
17.5. But what then were the ointments, but the
commandments of the Word? What was the oil, but the
power of the Holy Spirit, in which after washing believers are
anointed as with myrrh? 17.6. Scripture, through the blessed
Susannah, long ago foreshadows these things for us, so that
now we who believe in God, may now, not as strangers,
understand the things which happen in the Church. But let us
believe these things which were foreshadowed long ago
through the patriarchs, just as also the apostle says, “These
things came upon them as examples, and he wrote for your
understanding, upon whom the ends of the ages have
come.”3
18.1. Because the garden, which was planted in Eden by
God, was intended to become a model and image of the
church, the lovers of learning must recognize this.
4
 18.2. For
it is necessary for the earthly things to reflect the heavenly
and for the earthly figures5
 to witness6
 to the spiritual and for
the transitory to expect the eternal, as God also commanded

Moses to make a tabernacle according to the model which was
shown to him on the mountain.
18.3. What was that which has been seen, but the images
of heavenly glories and heavenly forms1
, from which Moses
fashioned a tabernacle from incorruptible wood2
corresponding to the fleshly representation3
, so that for those
who regard fleshly things, these same people may be revealed as
terrestrial, but for those who regard spiritual things, these same
people may become celestial?
18.4. And so Eden is called a place of delight, this is the
Garden4
. It was planted in the east, being adorned with
seasonable trees and all kinds of fruits, so that the community
of the righteous must understand that the place is holy, in
which the Church was planted. 18.5. For neither is a mere
place able to be a called the Church, nor a house which is
built with stone and clay, nor a man himself able to call
himself the Church. For a house is destroyed and a man dies.
18.6. And so, what is the Church? The community of Saints
participating5
 in truth.
18.7. Therefore unanimity6
 and way of the saints7
, this
becomes8
 the Church, the spiritual House of God, which was
planted in Christ as it was planted in the east, in which diverse
and blossoming trees were introduced and appeared, and the
generation of the fathers from the beginning were
distinguished and the works of the prophets, which were
fulfilled after9
 the Law, the chorus of both the apostles, who

make men become wise through the Word, and of all the
martyrs, who will be saved through the blood of Christ, and
the calling of the virgins, who are sanctified through water,
the chorus of disciples and the order of bishops, both priests
and Levites, these are the Church.
18.8. And having been adorned in every manner and
diversity, all these things flourish1
 in the Church, being unable
unable to be destroyed2
, and by partaking of their fruit we
rejoice because3
 by eating of them we enter into spiritual and
heavenly delight.
18.9. For the blessed patriarchs themselves minister the
oracles of God to us, just like the blossoming trees which
were planted in the garden also bear fruit among themselves
at all times, so that the sweet4
 Christ may be presented; that is
the fruit of life which was given to us, so that we may know
these things until now.
18.10. In this Eden a river of everlasting water flows and
four rivers, which stream from it, pour over all the land of
men, as also is shown to happen in the Church. For the river,
being Christ, though the fourfold saving Gospel, watches
carefully over all and is present in all. But also Christ irrigates
and waters all who believe in him, as the prophet says,
“Rivers gush from his heart.”5
18.11. And so in the Garden there was exhibited a tree of
knowledge and a tree of life, as now in the Church are the
Law and the Word like two trees which were planted. For
through the knowledge of the Law came sin, but through the
Word, life and forgiveness of trespasses is given. 18.12. For
even then Adam, having disobeyed God and, after tasting
from the tree of knowledge, became an outcast of the garden,

being cast out from the land into a land where he again1
wanders.
18.13. Similarly again2
 he who has believed and, after not
keeping the commandments, strips naked3
 the Holy Spirit,
becomes an outcast of the Church, but the earth no longer
receives him, and becoming like the man of old4
, he is bound
to wander.
19.1. For therefore when Scripture says, “Susannah
entered and walked around in the garden of her husband,”5
 it
indicates that all the kings and those in preeminence plant
gardens for themselves in cities and lands in order to delight
in them, as Jehoiakim did in Babylon. 19.2. For there was a
garden adjacent to his house in which Susannah entered and
was walking around in, having been devoted to prayer and
having sung6
 hymns and songs to God, who sent forth the
two handmaidens to carry the prescribed things in order to
wash.
19.3. “But they shut the doors of the garden7
, and exited
through the narrow8
doors,”9
 in this proclaiming beforehand
the future things, because he who wishes to partake of the
water of the garden ought to renounce the wide doors, and
enter through the strait and narrow door10
. 19.4. “And they did
not see the elders, because they were hidden.”11 For just as
then in the garden the devil was hidden in the serpent, in this

way even now, after hiding himself in the elders he craves
lust, so that again a second time he may destroy Eve.
20.1. “And it happened as the maidens went out, the
elders also rose and ran to Susannah1
 and said, ‘Behold, the
doors of the garden are locked and no one sees us and we lust
for you2
. Therefore consent to use and lie3
 with us. But if
not, we will testify against you that a young man was with you
and on account of this you sent the maidens away from
you.’”4
20.2. O lawless rulers and leaders who are filled with
diabolical activity! 20.3. Did Moses hand down these things to
you? In this way, acknowledging5
 the law do you teach other
things? He who says to not commit adultery does he himself
commit adultery? He who preaches not to murder, does he
himself murder? He who says not to lust, do you wish to
destroy your neighbor’s wife?
20.4. You say to me, rulers of Israel, “God, who has made
all things, he does not see,” do you not? The day and the sun,
do they not see your work? And the earth, which is defiled
by you, does it not cry out? 20.5. Why do you, lawless ones,
mislead a chaste and pure soul with lying words so that you
might stir up your lust? 20.6. You are characteristic of the
story of6
 Naboth the Israelite, who did not consent to give his
his vineyard to Ahab, so that he could have7
 a vegetable
garden, and on account of this the righteous man, after being
accused, was unrighteously killed.8

20.7. These things of yours from the beginning were
shameless terrors1
 on account of the deceiver who from the
beginning was in you. 20.8. For with her there really was a
youth from heaven2
, who did not have intercourse with her,
but came to her assistance.
21.1. And so after hearing these words, the blessed
Susannah was pricked in the heart and girded3
her body, as she
she did not want4
 to be defiled by the lawless elders. 21.2.
And this occurrence had5
 to truly overcome Susannah. For
you may now also find this fulfilled in the Church. 21.3. For
when the two peoples6
 agree to destroy the lives7
 of saints,
they observe a fitting day and after rushing into the house of
God, while all the people pray and hymn to God there, they,
laying hold of them, drag them8
 into court9
 and arrest them
saying, “Come, consent to us and sacrifice to our gods, but if
not we will testify against you.” Of those not willing, they,
leading them to the platform, charge them as practicing what
is contrary to the decree of Caesar and they condemn them to
death.
22.1.“Then Susannah, having sighed deeply, said ‘I am in
dire straits10 for if I would do this now, it is death to me, yet if

before the Lord.’”1
22.2. Behold, the words of the chaste
woman who also heeded God. She says “I am in dire
straits,2
” for the Church is not only persecuted and
oppressed3
 by the Jews, but also by the gentiles4
 and by those
those who falsely call themselves Christians, who always,
beholding the temperance and tranquility5
 of the Church6
, use
use force to destroy her.
22.3. “And so if,” she says, “I would do this, it is death to
me.”7
 For to disobey God and to obey men is death and
works eternal punishment. 22.4. “Yet if I would not, I will
not escape your hands.”8
 And she has said this true word. For
For those who are brought forward for the sake of the Name
of Christ, if they would do what is commanded by men, they
die to God, but live to the world; but if they do not do what is
commanded, they do not escape the hands of the judges, but
being condemned by those same judges, they die.
22.5. For it is better9
 for us, having not done what is
commanded by men, to fall into their hands than to sin before
the Lord. For this is more profitable: to be put to death
unrighteously by men, so that we may live with God, than,
consenting to them and, after being ruined by them, to fall
into the hands of God. 22.6. “For on account of this our
Lord Jesus Christ also lived and died and rose again, so that
he might reign over the living and the dead”10

preached in all the earth until now. 23.2. And so I exhort all
those who read this writing3
, women and virgins, the small and
and the great, holding before your eyes the judgment of God,
taking her example, imitate her and, as Susannah was justified
by God and was able to be delivered from the second death
by the word which was administered through4
 Daniel, so too
will you be.
23.3. For men on the one hand who seek the temperance
of Joseph, and, on the other hand, women who seek the purity
and faith of Susannah, do not give in to the censure of
blasphemy against yourselves, so that you do not credit5
 what
is said by the two elders as truth. 23.4. For many liars and
soul-deceivers6
 have crept in, deceiving the pure7
 souls of the
the saints, who destroy women with persuasive words and
drag them on for the sake of their own lust, who upset8
 men
with heretical sayings, so that their own will9
 may be
accomplished.
23.5. On this account the apostle, foreseeing the things
which will be, said, “I fear that, as the serpent deceived Eve
by10 his villainy, your thoughts will be destroyed11 from the
knowledge which is in Christ.”12 23.6. I exhort all you saints,

be sober-minded, love the truth and take notice of the purity
of Susannah, who was not enslaved to the flesh, or to the lust
of pleasure, nor was carried away1
by the persons2
of the two
elders, but fearing God from a whole heart, she chose the
temporary death, so that she might escape the second death
of fire.
24.1. And so, after these things happened, Scripture says,
“And Susannah lamented with a great voice, but the two
elders cried out against her.”3
24.2. And so to whom did
Susannah cry out but to God, as Isaiah also says, “Then you
will cry out and God will hear you, while you are still talking
he will say ‘Behold, I am here.’”4
24.3. “But the two elders cried out against her.”5
 For the
lawless do not cease crying out against us and saying, “Take
such people from the earth. For it is not proper for them to
live.” 24.4. “And after running, one of the elders opened the
doors of the garden,”6
 exhibiting the broad and wide way,
through which they, who are misled to these doors, perish.
24.5. For the maidens revealed the straight and narrow door
to us, through which they also marched.
25.1. And the slaves, after hearing the voice of Susannah,
went in. But these elders, having opened the broad doors, did
the opposite, cunningly contriving a certain pretext of death
against her. 25.2. “But when the elders said their words the
slaves were exceedingly ashamed, because a wicked word was
never yet brought against her7

25.3. When one lives chastely from boyhood, beloved, he
forsakes the approval of men, even unto death. For the same
happened to Susannah, who from childhood attended
precisely to the law of Moses and, having lived chastely and
temperately, she made the saying which was spoken through
the two elders fruitless.
25.4. And in this way every believing man or believing
woman, if they, fearing God, keep the faith which one has
received, they will not sin. 25.5. But if one ever should say they
are a believer, but does deeds of unbelief, such a one receives
from God double judgment, even if now they expect to
escape notice in this world.
26.1. “And it happened on the next day, as the people
came together at the house of her husband Jehoiakim, the two
elders came, who were full of designs of lawlessness against
Susannah in order to kill her, and they said before the people,
‘Send for Susannah, daughter of Hilkiah, who is the wife of
Jehoiakim.’ And they sent for her and she and her parents and
her children and all of her relatives entered.”2
26.2. This is seen even now. For when one of the saints
is seized, he is brought to the court, there all people run
together to see what will happen to him.3
26.3. “Susannah
was beautiful to see and exceedingly pleasing to the eye.”4
 For
the beauty that surrounds her, is not the beauty of a harlot’s
body, which surrounds a woman in the manner of Jezebel, nor
the beauty of the face, which is covered with many kinds of
makeup5
, but she had the beauty6
 of faith and of chastity and
of holiness.

26.4. “The lawless ones commanded her to be unveiled1
,
for she was covered, in order that her beauty may be
fulfilled.”2
 Let us consider, beloved, of what evil this action
was. For while the apostle said, “A woman ought to have a
veil upon her head on account of the angels,”3
 these men did
the opposite, they commanded that she be unveiled4
 in front
of the people and at this they were not ashamed.
26.5. “Standing in the midst of the people they placed
their hands upon her head,”5
 so that even while touching her
they might slake6
 the glut of their own lust. 26.6. “But she,
while wailing, looked up to heaven. For her heart was relying
on the Lord.”7
 For through her tears she attracted the Word
from the heavens, who through her tears was destined to
awaken the dead Lazarus.8
27.1. “The elders said, ‘While we were walking around in
the garden alone, she entered with two handmaidens and she
closed the doors of the garden and she sent away the
handmaidens and a young man came to her, who was hidden
and he reclined with her. But we, being in a secluded area9
 of
of the garden, seeing the lawlessness, ran to them. And
seeing them having relations with each other10 there we were
not able to get a hold of him on account of the fact that he was
stronger than us and, having opened the doors, he escaped.
But we, having reached her, asked who the young man was,

and she did not wish to tell1
 us. These things we witnessed.’
And they believed them as elders of the people and judges
and they condemned her to die.”2
27.2. And so it is necessary for us to be steadfast in all
matters and not to heed lying words, nor to be easily carried
away nor be misled at the persons3
 of rulers, knowing that we
have to give an account to God. But rather we ought to attain to
the truth and seek the exactness of faith, in order that we may
be acceptable to God. 27.3. For long ago the sons of Israel,
who carelessly trusted the rulers and did not examine the
truth, became guilty of murder, unrighteously condemning
Susannah.
27.4. But she, invoking the advocate from heaven, cried
out saying, “Eternal God, who knows the secret things, who
sees all things before they are4
, you know that they have
falsely testified lies against me.”5
27.5. For as many as call
upon him with a pure heart, God listens to them. But as
many as call upon him in treachery and hypocrisy, he turns his
face from them.
28.1. Scripture says, “And while she was being carried off
to be killed, God raised up the holy spirit of a young boy,
who was Daniel by name. And he cried out with a great
voice, ‘I am innocent6
 of this woman’s blood.’”7
28.2. And so
what is this which has happened, beloved? For we have been
informed beforehand. On account of what reason did this
assistance8
 from the Lord not happen before her

condemnation, but rather while she was being led away to be
killed? It happened in this way so that the majesty and the power
of God may be exhibited.
28.3. And so how is this right? When one wishes to
redeem one of his slaves, he is able to redeem him and to
save him, whenever he wishes and as he wishes. But when he
wishes to seize a slave1
, he is allowed to kill him, so that
having endured punishments as genuine truth, and after being
crowned, God might glorify him.
2
28.4. For after Susannah prayed and was heard, an angel
of the Lord was sent as her advocate and became her helper,
so that he might destroy those who were against her. 28.5.
Who, after seeing the on-rush3
, the blessed Daniel, as he was
a prophet and possessed the Spirit of God, cried out saying,
“I am innocent4
 of this woman’s blood”,5
 so that he himself
might not also become guilty of murder, in which manner
also Pilate did to Christ, who washed his hands with water,
saying “I am innocent6
 of this man’s blood.”7
29.1. But perhaps someone will say that this is said to be
unwritten and it is not possible to know if Daniel saw an
angel and cried out, “I am innocent of this woman’s blood.”8
29.2. If you wait a little, O man, Daniel himself will teach you!
29.3. “For after the people heard the voice and were
amazed, Daniel9
 answered them, ‘Are you so dull, sons of
Israel? Having not examined, nor discovered what is clear,

you condemn a daughter of Israel? And now return to the
place of judgment, for they have falsely-testified lies against
her.’ And the people turned back with haste.”1
 But the
lawless ones, jeered at Daniel and set him at naught, as just a
young boy, not seeing the power of the Word in him, but the
people2
 considered and said, “Come sit in the midst of us and
explain this to us because God has given to you the
presbytery.”3
29.4. He said, “‘Separate them a great distance from one
another and I will interrogate them.’ When they were
separated, one from the other, and after summoning one elder,
he said to him ‘You are decrepit with wicked days; now your
sins, which you did formerly, have arrived, you who
propound4
 unrighteous judgments and condemn the
innocent, but free the guilty, though the Lord says, ‘The
innocent and righteous you shall not kill.’5
 And so now if you
you did indeed see her, tell me, under what tree did you see
them having relations with one another?’ He said, ‘Under the
Mastic tree.’ But Daniel said, ‘You have lied directly upon
your own head. For already the angel of God has come,
taking the sentence from God to cut you in half.’”6
29.5. And so Daniel interrogated him and he utterly
destroyed him. For when he said, “Already the angel of God
has come taking the sentence from God to cut you in half.”7

It is clear that when Susannah prayed to God and was heard,
then the angel was sent out to help8
 her. 29.6. In which

manner also happened to Tobit and Sarah1
. For they, after
praying, in the same hour and the same day the entreaty of
the two was heard and the angel Raphael was sent out to cure
the two.
29.7. And so in this way Scripture foretold through the
prophet Amos to the house of Israel saying, “If the Lord
God does a deed2
 will he not reveal it first to his slaves the
prophets?”3
 The vision occurred to Daniel and the Holy
Spirit was awakened in him, so that after the examination
which was performed by him occurred the angel slayed them as
wicked false-witnesses.
30.1. But since we have already described in the prelude,
that the two elders refer to a model of two peoples, one from
the circumcision the other from the gentiles, who also are
always becoming plotters against the church, we see the words
of Daniel himself and learn that in nothing does Scripture
deceive us.
30.2. For when he said to the first elder, “You are decrepit
with wicked days; now your sins which you did formerly, have
arrived, you who propound4
 unrighteous judgments and
condemn the innocent, but free the guilty, though the Lord
says ‘The innocent and righteous you shall not kill’
5
.”6

Daniel7
 speaks to one who knows and loves the law.8
30.3. To the other elder he did not speak in this way, but
he said to him, “You seed of Canaan and not of Judah.”9

points out Canaan recalling him as being such a gentile,
having spoken to him as uncircumcised in this way, “‘Has lust
deceived you and beauty perverted your heart? You did this
thing to the daughters of Israel, and they, fearing you, had
relations with you, but the daughter of Judah did not endure
your disgrace. And so now if you did indeed see her, tell me,
under what tree did you see them having relations with one
another?’ And he said ‘Under the oak.’ But Daniel said, ‘You
have also lied directly against your own head. For the angel
of God is about to cut you in half, so that he may destroy you
both.’”1
31.1. And so in order that the sacredness of the holy
writings may be kept in all places and the pure mouth of the
blessed prophets may be proclaimed, for words we interpret
words and for phrases we reckon phrases2
. 31.2. For then
while the elders plotted through wicked words to hide3
 their
desire and shamelessly said, “We saw them having relations4
with each other,
5
”
6
 the blessed Daniel examined7
 what was
both disgracefully and repulsively spoken by them, saying to
them, “Under what tree did you see them lying with one
another?”8
 For there is another sense of the phrase, “lying with
someone,” and another sense of “having relations with someone.”
32.1. Accordingly, after these things happened Scripture
says, “All the gathering9
 cried out in a great voice and gave

praise to God because Daniel convicted they who falsely
testified from their mouth.”1

32.2. And so what shall we say? While one said, “The
Mastic tree”, yet the other said, “The oak,” in this there is a
proof of God. 32.3. For what did they plan to say? “When we,
while we were in possession of the young man, saw him, we
did not unmistakably see what kind of tree it was.” 32.4. But
since divine Scripture instructs us in all things, leading us to
truth, in this it is necessary to know2
 that they were
constrained by the Spirit to name such trees which were not
planted in the garden, so that, behold, out of their own
mouths they accuse themselves. For if they named some of
those which were planted there, they likely would have
persuaded the people with this word. But now it is not so,
but the things which happened are displayed.
32.5. For after Daniel tested the misgivings of their
hearts3
 and also their terrible lust, through their words, which
they still had before4
their eyes, and after declaring their secret
errors which they did long ago to the daughters of Israel, and
having revealed them, they themselves were tested by the
Holy Spirit, and being darkened in mind they named foreign5
trees, so that through their words they are shackled by their
own selves.6
33.1. After which7
 all the people and all her relatives
having heard this, shouted, saying “They lied! For neither a
Mastic tree nor an oak have been planted in the Garden.”8

33.2. After this, all the assembly1
 having risen, gave praise to
God who saves those who hope in him. And they stood up
against the two elders and did to them in which manner they
wickedly wanted to do to their neighbor and killed them,
because Daniel convicted2
 them from their own mouth as
having borne false witness,”3
 so that what was spoken was
fulfilled, “He who digs a trench for his neighbor, he himself
falls into it,”4
 “And blameless blood was saved in that day.”5
33.3. “And Hilkiah and his wife praised God concerning
their daughter with Jehoiakim her husband and all the
assembly6
, because a shameful matter was not found in her.
And Daniel became great before the people from that day
and beyond.”7
34.1. And so we ought to attend to all matters8
 beloved,
not fearing that someone who is caught in some trespass
indicts his own soul, knowing that God is an advocate for all,
he himself being the all-seeing eye9
, nothing which is
committed in the world escapes his notice. Therefore,
wakeful-ones who always live chastely from the heart10, imitate
Susannah and delight in the garden and enjoy the everflowing water and, having been smeared with all filth,
consecrate yourselves with heavenly oil, so that you may offer a
pure body to God and kindle your lamps and await the
bridegroom, so that, striking this chord, you may be admitted

Book 2
Concerning the image which king
Nebuchadnezzar set up
Nebuchadnezzar’s forgotten dream
1.1. “In the second year of Nebuchadnezzar’s kingdom,
Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a dream and his spirit was amazed,
and his sleep departed1
 from him. And the king said to call
the enchanters and the magicians2
 and the sorcerers and the
Chaldeans to proclaim to the king his dream. And they came
and stood before the king. And the king said to them, ‘I
dreamed and my spirit was amazed to know the dream.’ And
the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Syriac, ‘O king, live
forever! Tell the dream to all your servants, and we will
proclaim the interpretation.’ But the king answered the
Chaldeans, ‘The memory3
 has departed from me. And so, if
you do not make known the dream to me and its
interpretation you shall be destroyed4
 and your houses shall
be plundered. But if you do make known the dream and its
interpretation to me, you will receive gifts and presents and
much honor from me, only proclaim to me the dream and its
interpretation.’”5
2.1. And so, the dream which was seen by the king was
not earthly, that it might be interpreted by the wise men of the
world, but it was heavenly, according to the plan and
foreknowledge of God, which is fulfilled in their own times.

2.2. And on account of this it was concealed from men who
comprehend1
 earthly things, so that to those who seek
heavenly things, the heavenly mysteries may be revealed.
2.3. For also in Egypt it happened similarly to Pharaoh.
2.4. For he, seeing dreams, related them to all the interpreters
of Egypt, and there was no one who declared them to Pharaoh.
But when the blessed Joseph was present, the dreams, which
were not apprehended by others, were in good time, unveiled.
And on account of this the king2
, having been astonished,
answered all his slaves, saying, “Have we ever found such a
man, in whom is the Spirit of God?”3
 Therefore, Scripture is
indicating that no one will be able to describe the heavenly
mysteries, unless he should interpret4
them as a partner5
 of the
Holy Spirit.
2.5. Therefore, in this way the vision was concealed from
the king in Babylon, so that he who was chosen by God, was
shown as being Daniel the prophet. For whenever6
a vision is
hidden from others, yet is unveiled by another, this inevitably7
inevitably7
 displays the one speaking as a prophet.
3.1. Therefore, so that the Chaldeans, who had plotted in
some way, would not deceive king with words of deceit,
Nebuchadnezzar, who was sorely pricked, said to them, “‘I
myself know, in truth, that you are buying time, because you
see that the matter has departed from me. And so if you do
not report to me the dream, I know that you have contrived
to say a false and twisted word before me until the matter is
forgotten8
.’ The Chaldeans answered the king saying, ‘There

is not a man on earth who is able to make known the king’s
concern1
, because every great king and ruler does not ask
such a matter of an enchanter, magician, sorcerer, or
Chaldean, because the word which the king asks is difficult2
,
and there is not another being who is able to proclaim it before
the king, except the gods whose dwelling is not with flesh3
.’”4
flesh3
.’”4
3.2. After these things were said, the king, having become
angered, “ordered that all the wise men of Babylon be killed.
And the edict went out that the wise men be killed.”5
4.1. And so since they said that what the king sought was
impossible to be recounted by a man, God showed them that
the things which are impossible with men, are possible with
God. 4.2. For Arioch the Chief-Butcher6
 was about to kill
both Daniel and his three friends, for he went out to kill the
wise men of Babylon. For Scripture said that the ChiefButcher7
 himself began to take the sword. For even as a
butcher kills all creatures and butchers them, in the same way
also the rulers of this world kill men, butchering them as
unreasoning animals, but Daniel went forth and said, “‘For
what reason has this reckless proposition come out from the
face of the king?’ For he sought to learn from him for what
reason the Babylonians were slaughtered8
.”9
4.3. And “Arioch

having heard this, asked him a request, in order that he might
give time to him so that2
 he might make known the
interpretation to the king.3
5.1. “Then Daniel went into his house and made known
the matter to Ananiah and Mishael and Azariah. And they
sought mercies from the God of the heaven so that they
would not also be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of
Babylon. Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a
dream at night and Daniel blessed the God of heaven saying,
‘May the name of the Lord be blessed forever and ever4
,
because wisdom and understanding and strength are his. And
he himself changes seasons and times, and he appoints kings
and removes them, who gives wisdom to the wise and insight5
to those who see with understanding. He himself reveals
deep and hidden6
things, knowing the things in darkness, and
light is with him. To you, God of my fathers, I give thanks
and I praise you, because you have given to me wisdom and
power and you have made known to me what we asked of
you and you have made known to me the matter of the
king.”7
5.2. And so it is necessary for us to know the kindheartedness of God, how to the worthy and to those who fear
him, he swiftly reveals and unveils, fulfilling their petitions
and requests, as the prophet says, “What wise man
understands these things? Does even a man of understanding
also know these things.”

6.1. After this happened, Daniel rose and went to Arioch
and said to him, “Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon,
but bring me before the king and I will proclaim to the king
the dream and its interpretation.”1
6.2. He, after hearing these things “brought in Daniel with
haste and said. ‘I found a man from the sons of the captivity
of Judah, who will proclaim the interpretation to the king.’”2
6.3. He was astounded3
and said to Daniel, “‘Are you able to
proclaim the dream which I saw and its interpretation?’ And
Daniel said ‘The mystery which the king asks about is not for4
magicians, enchanters, or soothsayers to proclaim to the king,
but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and
makes known to king Nebuchadnezzar what must be5
 in the
last days.’”6
6.4. See how through these words he saves7
 the
Chaldeans from the danger which was to kill them and he
teaches the king not to seek heavenly mysteries from earthly
men, mysteries which are about to be fulfilled by God in his
own times. 6.5. And on account of this he, sending the mind
of the king up to God, said, “There is a God in heaven who
reveals mysteries,”8
 who receives9
 the man who requests
mercies and petitions.
6.6. Just as he himself also, being lowly and humbling
himself, and not boasting, though he was found wiser than
the all of the Babylonians, said, “Moreover this mystery was
not revealed to me because the wisdom in me is greater than all
those who dwell upon the earth, rather it was revealed to me for

the sake of making known the interpretation to the king, so
that you may know the considerations of your heart.”
1
6.7. For after the king had taken Egypt and after taking
over the Jewish land and deporting the people, he considered
upon his bed what was there to do after these things. 6.8. But
he who knows the secrets of all and searches the
considerations of the hearts, revealed to the king2
 what will be
be through the image, but God3
 hid the vision from him, so
that the plans of God would be able to be explained not by
the wise men of the Babylon, but by the blessed Daniel, in as
much as the things which were hidden from all, were revealed
by the prophet of God.
7.1. In all events Scripture says, “You, O king, were
looking, and behold, one image: Great was that image and its
appearance was fearful. The head of the image4
 was of pure
gold, its hands and chest and its arms were silver, the stomach
and thighs were bronze, its legs were iron, the feet were part
iron, part clay. You were looking until you saw a stone, which
was cut without hands and it struck the image at the iron and
clay feet and crushed it completely5
. Then once for all, the
clay, iron, bronze, silver and gold were ground and they
became like chaff from the summer threshing floor. And the
greatness of the wind carried them away and no place was
found for them. And the stone which struck the image
became a great mountain and it filled all the earth. This is the
dream and we will tell its interpretation before the king. You,
O king, are the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has
given a strong, mighty, and honorable kingdom in every place
where the sons of men dwell, and he has given into your
hand beasts of the field and birds of heaven and he has

ordained you Lord of all. You are the head of gold. And after
you another kingdom shall arise, which is lesser than you.
And a third kingdom shall arise which is bronze, which shall
rule over all the earth. And a fourth kingdom will be strong
as iron. In the way which iron grinds and subdues all, in this
way it will grind and subdue all. And because you saw the
feet and the toes, part of which were iron, part of which were
clay, the kingdom shall be divided, and in it there shall be
from the nature1
 of iron, in which manner, you saw iron
mixed with clay. And the toes of the feet, part of which were
iron, part of which were clay: part of the kingdom will be
strong, but it shall be broken2
 because you saw iron mixed
with clay, they shall be mingled in the seed of men and one
shall not cleave with the other, just as iron does not mix with
clay. In the days of those kings, the God of heaven shall set
up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed3
, and the
kingdom shall not be left for another people. It shall grind
and crush all the kingdoms and it shall be set up forever4
, in
which manner you saw that a stone was cut from a mountain
without hands and ground the clay, iron, bronze, silver, and
gold. The great God has made known to the king what is
necessary to happen after these things. And the dream is true
and its interpretation is faithful.”5
8.1. Nebuchadnezzar, after hearing these things, and after
remembering the dream, recognized that what was spoken by
Daniel was true, and, “he fell on his face and he worshipped
Daniel and commanded slaves to offer gifts and perfumes to
him.”6

8.2. How strong is the grace of God, beloved, so that
shortly before1
 he was about to be killed with the rest of the
wise men of Babylon, the king fell on his face and no longer
worshipped this man as a man but as God and commanded
slaves to offer gifts and perfumes to him. 8.3. For also long
ago the Lord announced the same thing to Moses saying,
“Behold, I have given you as God2
 to Pharaoh,”3
 so that
through the signs which happened under him in Egypt,
Moses no longer was acknowledged as a man, but as God4
worshipped by the Egyptians.
9.1. And so Nebuchadnezzar, having been astounded at
what was spoken by Daniel, said, “In truth your God, he
himself is God of gods and Lord of those who rule, who also
reveals mysteries, because he was able to reveal this mystery!’
And the king promoted5
 Daniel and gave him many great6
gifts and appointed him over all the lands of Babylonians and
appointed him as chief of the satraps over all the wise men of
Babylon.”7
9.2. For since he himself humbled himself and declared
himself to be the least of all men, the king extolled him and
appointed him ruler of all the lands of Babylon. 9.3. In which
manner Pharaoh also did to Joseph, having then appointed
him ruler of all the land of Egypt. 9.4. For none of the men in
all Egypt was found who was able to proclaim visions to
Pharaoh, except Joseph alone, and none of the wise men in
Babylon was able to declare the visions to the king, except
Daniel alone.

9.5. For God leads forth holy men to himself from
generation to generation, who is obligated1
 to be glorified in
all the world.
10.1. “And Daniel asked a favor from the king and he
appointed Shadrach, Mishach, and Abednego over the affairs
of the country of Babylon.”2

10.2. And this which happened under Daniel is worthy of
faith and approval3
. For since they themselves joined4
 with
Daniel in prayer to God, so that the vision might be revealed
to him, and because of this Daniel himself received worth and
honor from the king, Daniel remembered them and entrusted
them with the work which happened under them on behalf of
the king, so that they themselves also were esteemed with
some honor as fellow-initiates and God-fearing men. 10.3.
For after requesting the heavenly things from the Lord, they
were also engaged with the earthy things beside the king.
11.1. And so since the blessed Daniel described the vision
and was not silent about its interpretation, he left behind some
questions5
 for those who possess a keen6
 mind, so that again
what was spoken by Daniel may be explained by another.
11.2. Yet it is necessary for the lovers of truth, to not merely
read cursorily, but to seek to say the obscure and to
understand what was spoken by the prophets.7

11.3. For Daniel1
 sees a great image, and the head of this
he likens to be as pure gold. Next, the shoulders and chest he
describes as being silver. Then, the stomach and thighs are
bronze. Next, the legs are iron. Likewise also the toes of the
feet are clay and iron which has been mixed together2
. Then,
a stone, which is cut from a mountain without hands, strikes
the image and grinds it. And the same stone became a great
mountain and filled all the earth.
11.4. After saying these things concerning the image, he
afterwards divides the image3
, in accordance with its sections4
,
sections4
, into kingdoms and he explains5
each part of the statue
statue proceeding to each part, saying that the gold is king
Nebuchadnezzar himself, describing him to be the golden
head of the image. 11.5. Next, he names a second kingdom,
implying that it is inferior, saying that it is silver. 11.6. Next, a
third which is bronze. 11.7. Then, a fourth strong kingdom,
which is iron. 11.8. Next, the clay and iron, having been mixed
together, exhibit the tips of the feet of the image.
11.9. For I have begun from the head because6
 it displays
the gold. Next, the chest and arms and he names them silver.
Then, the stomach and thighs, and he indicates them to be
bronze. Next, he describes the legs, and he shows them to be
iron. Then, the feet and ten toes, and he declares them to be
clay and iron, after these things there is nothing left to see, but
the stone which is cut from a mountain and which struck the
image, and it became in the end a great mountain which also
filled all the earth.

being fulfilled in the world? 12.2. For the image which was
portrayed according to that season, embraced the model of
the kingdom of all the world. 12.3. In which season the
Babylonians then reigned, as being the golden head of the
image.
12.4. Then after them the Persians ruled for two hundred
forty-five years as they are shown to be silver.
12.5. After them the Greeks ruled, beginning from
Alexander of Macedon, for three hundred years, as they are
bronze.
12.6. After them the Romans, who are the iron legs of the
image, being strong as iron.
12.7. Next the toes of the feet, so that in each place
democracies are shown, which are destined to be and which
are divided into the ten toes of the image, in which the iron
will have been mixed with clay.1
13.1. After these things, what does Daniel say? “A stone
was cut without hands and struck the image.”2
13.2. For in all
events after the iron was mixed with clay and spread to the
tips of the toes and while they are3
 discordant with one
another of the seed of men, what is left which is necessary to
await but Christ who comes from the heavens as a stone
which is cut from a mountain, so that he removes the
kingdoms of this world, but also sets up the heavenly
kingdom of the saints which will never be destroyed, and the
same mountain also became the city of the saints which fills
all the earth.
13.3. And on account of this blessed Daniel spoke, “And
after the end of those days God shall set up the kingdom of

heaven which shall never be destroyed1
, and the kingdom
shall not be left for another people.”2
13.4. Therefore, so that
one may not mistrust what was spoken and ask whether these
things really will be or not, the prophet seals it, saying, “and
the dream is true and its interpretation is faithful.”3
Nebuchadnezzar sets up a golden image; Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego refuse to worship
14.1. “In the eighteenth year, Nebuchadnezzar the king
made a golden image, its height was sixty cubits and its
breadth was six cubits, and he set it in the plain of Deira in the
country of Babylon. And he sent out a command to bring
together the governors, captains and rulers, leaders and chiefs
and those in authority and all the rulers of the countries, and
to come to the consecration of the image which
Nebuchadnezzar the king set up. And all were brought
together. And they came and stood before the image. And a
herald shouted in strength, ‘To you it is said, peoples, tribes,
tongues, at the hour which you hear the sound of the
trumpet, pipes and lyres, harp and psaltery and all the family
of musical instruments, you shall fall down and worship the
golden image. And whoever does not fall to worship4
, the
same hour he shall be cast into the burning furnace of fire.’”5
15.1. And so, after sufficient time had passed and the
eighteenth year had come, the king, having remembered his
dream, made a golden image, which was sixty cubits high and
its breadth was six cubits. 15.2. For when the blessed Daniel,
when he interpreted the same dream6
, answered the king

saying, “You are the head of the golden image,”1
 in this word
king Nebuchadnezzar, having been puffed up2
 and having
been lifted up in heart, made the image as an anti-type of the
dream3
, so that he might be worshiped as God by all.
15.3. And so having furnished it in greatness he set it up
in the plain of Deira in the country of Babylon. 15.4. And
having sent out a command he summoned together the
governors, captains and rulers and all of those in authority to
come to the consecration of the image, which
Nebuchadnezzar the king set up. 15.5. And so then, while all
the men were coming together for the event4
 and while the
musical instruments rang out together, at that moment5
 the
peoples, tribes, and tongues, fell down and worshipped the
image, some of them only because they feared the king, but all
became idolaters, and they heeded the word which was
prescribed by the king.
16.1. “Then some of the Chaldeans came forward and
accused the Jews before the king, ‘You O king, have issued6
 a
a decree, that every man who shall hear the sound of the
trumpet, pipes and lyres, harp and psaltery and the orchestra
of all the family of musical instruments and does not fall down
to worship7
 the golden image shall be cast to the burning
furnace of fire. There are Jewish men whom you have
appointed over the affairs of the country of Babylon,
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who did not heed, O
king, your decree, who do not serve your gods and do not
worship the golden image which you set up!’ Then the king
after hearing this called in wrath and anger to bring them in

and Nebuchadnezzar1
 answered and said, ‘Is it true, Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego that you do not serve my gods and
worship the golden image which I have set up? And so, now
if you are prepared2
, when you should hear the sound of the
trumpet, pipes and lyres, harp and psaltery and all the family
of musical instruments, fall down and, worship the golden image.
But if not in the same hour you shall be cast into the burning
furnace of fire, and what god is there who shall take you out
of my hands?’”3
17.1. Do you see the boast4
 of the tyrannical human king,
who did not know he who said, “Do not fear men who are
able to kill the body, in this they are not able to kill what is
inside5
, but fear rather him who is able to destroy both soul
and body in hell6
.”7
17.2. The boys, who did not cower at these words,
answered saying, “We have no need to answer you
concerning this matter. For there is a God whom we serve,
he is able to deliver us from the burning furnace of fire and
from your hands, O king, he will rescue us, and if not, let it
be known to you O king that we will not8
 serve your gods
and we will not9
 not worship the golden image which you set
up.”10

nor, having heard the words of the king, were terrified, nor,
having seen the burning fire of the furnace, cringed, but they
despised all men and the whole world, holding the fear of
God alone before their eyes.
18.2. Daniel, who was standing a far way off and keeping
silent, taught these three1
 to be courageous, while smiling at
them, he himself even rejoicing at their witness, while
observing the three boys who were about to be crowned
against the devil. They were not deluded by musical skill nor
enslaved by the pleasure of the instruments, nor carried away
by the deceit of the Babylonians, nor subdued by the decree
of the king, nor did they bend their knees before the golden
image, which was wrought with a hammer. 18.3. These three
believing witnesses were found in Babylon, so that through
them God may be glorified and Nebuchadnezzar may be
shamed and the idols of the Babylonians be revealed as
nothing.
19.1. I will dare to say something and I will not venture to
say something else while speaking2
. These boys, having read the
contents of Scripture, saw what was spoken by the prophet,
that it was written concerning them. For how else did the
contents of Scripture say to Babylon, “I shall make mention of
Rahab and Babylon to those who know me,”3
 except if it
foresees by the Spirit the mysteries of the economy there?
19.2. For these, having seen all men worshiping the image and
heeding the prescription of the king, settled their minds to
speak. This is not idly written, brothers, this is similarly
fulfilled in us now.
19.3. For behold, it happened that even every family
received our captives and they became slaves to the

Babylonians.1
 Nebuchadnezzar, just as the great devil,
tyrannizes against us and having made a golden image
compels people to idolatry.
19.4. We the faithful stand fast2
 unto death, lest we
disgrace our teacher, Moses, or lest we permit our family to
be ridiculed. Let us, as the three boys, conquer all the power
of the Babylonians. God will deliver us from the hand of the
king, as he rescued our forefathers3
 from the hand of
Pharaoh.
19.5. Let us recall what happened long ago in the land of
Egypt. When the sea was struck with a staff, it was put to
flight and the Jordan River, when it saw the Ark, was turned
back to its source, and Rahab the prostitute, when she was
found faithful in the city of Jericho, she was preserved from
the slaughter of the sword. 19.6. And now God is able to
easily quench the fire of the furnace.
19.7. If you are threatened with the sword, let us submit
to death; if thrown to wild beasts4
 let us not cower before the
beasts. Let not the crowd of the Babylonians prevail in that
faithful day. 19.8. Urging one another on as living
combatants5
, the three young boys were led on by the Spirit
to the pit, contending before myriads of unbelieving men.
20.1. But someone will say, “You are making
sophistries.6
” 20.2. Be educated, O man, about the things which
happen under7
 Antiochus Epiphanes. 20.3. While the seven
brothers together with their mother were taken, they were
struck with scourges and whips, but one of them answered

the whips, and he said, “Why do you delay to ask and to
learn? For we are prepared to die rather than to transgress
our patriarchal1
 laws.”2
20.4. “But the king, becoming stirred up at this,
commanded pans and cauldrons to be heated at once, and he
commanded that the one of them who spoke first, that his
tongue be rooted out and having been scalped, to be
maimed.3
 While the rest of the brothers looked on, and while
the steam of the pans grew4
 sufficiently, he exhorted one
another in the voice of their fatherland5
 saying, ‘The Lord God
God watches over us, and in truth, he comforts us just as
Moses through the song which he spoke before God’s face
long ago saying, ‘He will be comforted in his slaves.’”6
21.1. You see how the Spirit of the Father cares for
martyrs, he teaches, while urging and encouraging them, to
despise this death and to hasten to what is better. 21.2. For if
anyone is apart from the Holy Spirit, this one cowers7
 in agony
agony and is afraid, and he hides and avoids8
 the temporary
death and cringes before the sword and does not submit to
retribution. He holds this world before his eyes, the cares of
life, and he prefers his wife and he loves9
 his own children and
and seeks the riches of property. Such a one does not
procure heavenly power and is recklessly destroyed.
21.3. And so it is necessary for every man who accepts the
Word, to listen to what the heavenly king and master
prescribes, “Whoever does not take up his cross and follow

after me, is not worthy of me,”1
 and “He who does not
renounce all his belongings2
 is not able to be my disciple.”3
22.1. And so even then, in this way the three boys, who
were disciples of faith in Babylon, answered the king saying,
“We have no need to answer you concerning this matter.”4
22.2. Daniel, having heard these words, approved.5
22.3. But again they said, “There is a God whom we serve,
he is able to deliver us from the burning furnace of fire and
from your hands, O king.”6
22.4. The Blessed Daniel, being a
prophet and foreseeing what is to come, approved as being
true what was spoken by them. And the boys, so that they
may exhibit to the king their unsurpassable faith7
, added
saying, “And if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we
will not8
 serve your gods and we will not9
 serve the golden
image which you set up.”10 22.5. Whom again the blessed
Daniel, having heard their voice a third time, and having been
amazed, crowned them in faith as speaking beautiful truths.11
23.1. You see the assurance of the words which were
spoken through one mouth, so that in no word may they
stumble. 23.2. For after the king threatened them and said,
“Why do you not serve my gods and not worship the golden
image which I set up?”12 They answered, “We have no need

 not regarding him
worthy of a defense of such a statement.
23.3. Then, after the king said, “You shall be cast into the
burning furnace of fire, and what god is there who shall take
you out of my hands?”2
 They added to the word which was
spoken by the king and said, “There is a God whom we serve,
he is able to deliver us from the burning furnace of fire and
from your hands, O king.” 23.4. After the king again said,
“And so, now if you are prepared3
, when you should hear the
sound of the trumpet, pipes and lyres, harp and psaltery and
all the family of musical instruments, fall down and worship the
golden image.”4
 They said to him, “Let it be known to you O
king that we will not5
 serve your gods and we will not6
worship the golden image which you set up.”7
24.1. For the king set before them three matters through
one word, like those who contend for three prizes in a contest,
so that even in one matter, having laid a trap, he might trip
these boys up. 24.2. But they, wishing to be defeated in
nothing, genuinely answered in three statements. 24.3. For they
set at naught the first matter of the king, showing that the
idol which was worshiped by him was not worthy of any
account.
24.4. Secondly, they taught the king that it is necessary to
fear and worship a certain king8
, saying, “There is a God
whom we serve, he is able to deliver us from the burning
furnace of fire.”9

their faith, they said, “And if not, let it be known to you, O
king, that we will not1
 serve your gods and we will not2
worship the golden image which you set up.”3
24.6. For in this, they fortified themselves through speech,
lest, after they were cast into the furnace, they would also be
incinerated and the Chaldeans would have boasted and
deceived the king saying, “Do not be vexed, O king, you
prevailed and you took the prize from them. For they,
shrieking and burning in the fire, were saying, ‘We beg you,
Lord and king, we will do what is commanded by you, we will
worship the image.’”
24.7. Therefore4
 after death believers, who did not wish
to give a place of pretext to the devil, are called martyrs,
according to every way they fortified themselves. 24.8. For
they who believe have carried up all authority and glory to
God, because he is able to deliver us, but if not we would
rather gladly die than to do what is prescribed by you,
Nebuchadnezzar!
25.1. “Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of wrath and the
countenance of his face was changed before Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego, and he said, ‘Heat the furnace seven
times hotter until it has been kindled to the limit.’ And he
commanded5
 strongmen, after binding them in strength, to
cast them into the burning furnace of fire. Then those men
were bound with their garments and cloaks …6
and were cast
into the burning furnace of fire according to the word of the
king.”7

25.2. And so indeed they prevailed, if it is necessary to
speak the truth, the boys…1
 For as strong as the word of the
boys was, so was the king wrathful and he said, “Heat the
furnace seven times hotter,” who was, as always, already
defeated by them. 25.3. For the king prevailed in terrestrial
matters, but the three boys prevailed in faith towards God.
25.4. But someone will say, “And so was not Daniel,
being a friend of the king, able to intercede2
 on their behalf
and pardon the three boys?” He was able, but it happened in
this way so that the great works of God may be shown and the
Babylonians may learn to fear God, and on account of this
find rest, so that also their faith may be shown and God may
be glorified in them. 25.5. For if this had not happened the
Babylonians would be able to say3
, “If Daniel did not
intercede4
 with the king on their behalf, these boys would
today be destroyed in fire,” and reckon grace to be human
rather than the power of God.
26.1. But why was the king not sorely pricked, having
actually seen Daniel, who was a Jew, and why did he not say to
him, “Why do you not worship the image?” He no doubt
would have said to the king, “Because I do not worship
works made with hands, but the living God who made
heaven and earth and has lordship over all flesh.”5
 Just as he
answered Cyrus in the presence of Bel. The king, having
been stunned6
, said to him… 26.2.…7
 Bel, except according
to the thoughts of the satraps. “For thirty days if one should

ask any God or man but from you, he shall be cast into the
den of lions.”1
26.3. So it was necessary for the three boys alone to be
glorified in the furnace, but before Bel and the reigning Cyrus,
it was necessary for Daniel alone to be cast into the den of lions,
each of them arranging their own part and observing their
own season, so that even Nebuchadnezzar the king of the
Babylonians, who saw that the three boys were not destroyed
by fire, may glorify God, and Cyrus the Persian, who saw that
Daniel was not swallowed by the lions, may be taught that
God alone is the God of heaven. 26.4. And so in this way in
due time God administers the affairs of men through his slaves
the prophets and persuades all men to come to knowledge of
himself.2
27.1. And so, “Then the boys, after being bound with
their garments and cloaks, were cast into the burning furnace
of fire according to the proclamation of the king.”3
27.2. Tell
me, Nebuchadnezzar, on what account do you order these
boys to be bound and cast into the fire? Lest they flee? Or
being released they quench the fire with their feet? But you
are not the one who does these things, but another in you,
who works these things.
27.3. And on account of this Scripture says, “Then the
form of the king was changed.”4
 For there was another person
there and Nebuchadnezzar5
 became another person. For the
king was a man who in the beginning feared God. Then,
having been lifted up against God6
 he changed, mimicking
the works of the devil. 27.4. And on account of this Scripture
beautifully predicts, saying, “I am God and I will not

change,”1
so that God may be shown as being unmoved and
unchangeable. The form of the king was changed so that he
may be easily perceived as being a man and so that the
deceiver who recklessly operates in him, may be recognized,
who at all times mimics the works of God and wishes to
beguile man in various ways.
27.5. For Scripture says, “In the eighteenth year,
Nebuchadnezzar the king made a golden image, its height was
sixty cubits, and its breadth was six cubits, and he set it in the
plain of Deira in the country of Babylon.”2
27.6. And so
through3
 eighteen years he imitated Jesus the son of God,
who was present in the world, who also raised his own human
image from the dead and showed this image, which was pure
and blameless as gold, to his disciples.
27.7. Through the height of sixty cubits, there are sixty
patriarchs, through whom the image of God according to the
flesh, that is the Word, is molded and fashioned and is exulted
on behalf of all the patriarchs. 27.8. Through the breadth of
six cubits this recalls the six days of creation4
. For on the sixth
day man, having been molded from dust, came to be. 27.9.
And so the gold which Nebuchadnezzar molded into the
representative5
 image which he made, he set it up on the plain
plain of Deira, in the country of Babylon, indicating the plain
to be the world, and Babylon the great city.
27.10. And at that time Nebuchadnezzar made only one
image, but now the deceiver devises6
 greater7
things in the
world, so that through the many spectacles he may delude8
 all
all men, some being carried about in one direction or

another1
, some worshiping golden idols, others silver, others
bronze, some that which is composed from ivory2
, many
revering clay and stone. They all, abandoning the heavenly
God, submit to empty and lifeless and useless idols, not
wishing to look up to the height of heaven, nor wishing to
apprehend the beauty of heaven, so that they, who do not
recognize the God of this heaven, are not able to be saved.
27.11. These things are the handiwork of the devil. He
worked not only long ago in Babylon, but also now he does
the same things and endeavors more reckless3
things against the
the slaves of God. Having prepared the furnace of fire
beforehand, so that through it he might frighten men, who do
not see the eternal punishment through fire which is prepared
for the devil4
 by God
28.1. Accordingly, after these things happened, Scripture
says, “And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach Abednego,
fell into the midst of the furnace while bound and that they
were walking in the midst of the flame, hymning to God and
blessing the Lord.”5
28.2. And so the bonds which the king put around them,
these the fire consumed immediately, yet it did not singe their
garments and cloaks so that even in this event the great work
of God may be shown. 28.3. For since the garments were clad
around the bodies of the boys, these also with them were
made holy and were not consumed by the fire, so that God6
,
with the boys7
, may be honored in their witness.
28.4. Let the arch-heretics, who deny the resurrection of
themselves, tell me, how do they say there is no resurrection

of the flesh, when the perishable garments and sandals, which
came from the death of living creatures, are not destroyed by
fire on account of the holiness which clothes their bodies?
How also does the flesh, which is perishable and which
clothes the holy soul, not also1
 with the soul2
 be made holy
and be changed into incorruptible?
28.5. For if what is corruptible in nature did not receive
corruption, how does what is incorruptible in nature, but has
died through disobedience, again having been made alive by
the power of God, not actually be made alive? 28.6. So that
the Scripture persuades us in every way to believe in God
from a whole heart, in which way those who are perfect, who
have believed, may be preserved from the furnace of fire as
perfect along with their garb and cloaks. 28.7. For if then the
fire did not tame them, how is the eternal fire able to master
the saints and they who similarly believe?

29.1. And so then, Azariah, having stood up together with
the rest, praised God through a hymn and a prayer in the
midst of the furnace. 29.2. And then they confessed the
former sins of themselves and their fathers, giving glory to
God as captives worthily and righteously suffering3
 these
things in a strange land, even though they were handed over to
the most lawless and knavish king in all the earth, instead of
their fathers who did not keep the law of their Lord God.
29.3. Then, addressing all creation as through one mouth,
they hymned and glorified and blessed God saying, “Blessed
are you Lord God of our fathers, praiseworthy are you and
exalted unto the ages.”4
29.4. And so, having begun from the

name of the holy and notable and magnificent, they came
upon the works of the Lord, first naming the heavenly things,
and they glorified him saying, “Bless the Lord all you works of
the Lord, hymn and exalt him forever.”1
29.5. Next they addressed all things successively: the seven
heavens and the authorities and powers in them, and the
water which is above heaven, and they came to the firmament
and, having named the lights in it, the sun and the moon and
the stars, they were saying, “All you planets which move in
heaven, bless, praise, and exalt him forever.”2
29.6. Then they
moved on to the direction of the air and the winds, which are
in the midst of creation, which become windstorms3
 and
snows, cold and heat, light and darkness, both day and night
and those things similar to them. Next they came to the
foundation of the earth.
29.7. They began first from the glory of God itself and
were glorifying him. Then what is above heaven, what is
called super mundane. Next they named the firmament with
the lights. Next what is in the midst of the firmament. 29.8.
Next they moved to the earth saying, “Bless the Lord you earth,
hymn and exalt him forever.”4
 Then the mountains and hills.
Next all things which grow upon the earth.
29.9. Then they moved to the waters, rivers, both springs
and seas. Next those which move in the waters both sea
monsters and fish. Then the birds of heaven and both
domestic and wild beasts. 29.10. Then they moved to the sons
of men, bringing them up according to the orderly hymn.
29.11. Then they named the things in the depths5
, the spirits of
the angels who control Tartarus and the souls of the

righteous so that they may also hymn to God along with the
three boys.1
29.12. And at the end of all this they named themselves as
last and least and lowly, “Bless the Lord, Ananiah, Azariah,
and Misahl, hymn and exalt him forever, because he took us
from Hades and saved us from the hand of death and rescued
us from the midst of burning flame and from the midst of
fire he rescued us. We give thanks to the Lord because he is
gracious, because his mercy is forever.”2
30.1. Tell me, you three boys, remember me, I entreat you,
that I also may obtain the same lot of martyrdom with you,
who was the fourth person with you who was walking in the
midst of the furnace and who was hymning to God with you
as from one mouth? Describe to us his form and beauty so
that we also, seeing him in the flesh3
, may recognize him.
30.2. Who was he who in this way orderly described all
creation through your mouth, so that you omitted nothing of
which is and has been?
30.3. Having done this for one hour in the furnace, you
taught the workmanship of creation. For the Word was with
you and was speaking4
 through you, the Word who
understands the workmanship of creation. 30.4. For it is
wonderful, beloved, what was spoken through hymns by the
three boys in the furnace. How they left nothing out of what
has been created, so that it may not be considered that they did
this by some independence or by their own power, but
embracing and naming all things, both heavenly and earthly
and subterranean, they showed all things to be slaves of God
who created all things through the Word, so that no one may

boast as being something unborn1
 or created without headship.
30.5. Accordingly, let the doctrines according to the archheretics cease, which name powers and ages and originators,
they invent empty tales2
, so that through strange words they,
having deceived, might easily kill men and compel them to
worship things that are not as though they were, others again
fashion images in the hearts of men just like Nebuchadnezzar
did. 30.6. For Scripture encompasses all things, whether rulers
or authorities or powers or thrones or dominions or every
name which is named3
 it subordinates and enslaves all things
to God, to praise and to bless and glorify him as Lord and
Master who made all things.
30.7. And on account of this Ananiah, Azariah, Misahl,
after declaring all things that exist, they added saying, “All
you pious, bless and hymn and praise the Lord God of gods
because his mercy is forever.”4

31.1. And so the Babylonians, seeing the three boys
hymning in the furnace, did not cease to heat the furnace with
resin, pitch, tar, and brushwood and the flame climbed5
 fortynine cubits above the furnace and spread out against they who
fought against the mighty God. 31.2. Scripture says, “The fire
broke out6
 and engulfed those whom it found around the
furnace of the Chaldeans.”7
31.3. See how the fire itself was prudent and recognized
and punished the culpable? For it did not singe the slaves of
God, but consumed the faithless and godless of the
Chaldeans, and those who were within the furnace were
besprinkled by an angel, but those careless ones who

imagined that they stood outside of the furnace, they were
destroyed by fire. 31.4. And as Scripture says, “The angel of
God descended into the furnace with those who were around
Azariah, and he shook off the flame of the fire of the furnace
and made the midst of the furnace like a breeze of dew which
whistles, and the whole fire did not singe them nor vex or
trouble them.”1
32.1. And so it is needful to ask,2
 who was this angel who
was revealed in the furnace and who preserved the boys as his
own children under his enfolding arms, and for those in the
midst of the furnace he turned3
 the fire into dew4
, but for those
those outside the fire he assigned his own standard of
judgment, as it is written, “With the measure you measure it
will be measured to you”?5
32.2. Let me not deceive, he was not any other person, but
the very one who judged the Egyptians with the water. In
return for they who at that time threw the newborn males of
the Hebrews into the river, they in the same way were
destroyed in the sea by being plunged righteously into the
water, so that a balanced recompense may be rendered to
those who practice wickedly.
32.3. This was he who received the authority of judgment
from the Father. He who also showered fire and divine
retribution upon the Sodomites, and destroyed them on
account of their lawlessness and wicked impiety. 32.4. And
Ezekiel agrees with this, who received and got possession of
fire in his hand, and awaits the voice of the Father, when he
shall command him to throw it upon the earth.6

32.5. They, having seen this fire in the furnace, and
having seen the light of this being eclipsed, trembled. 32.6.
Concerning this Isaiah says, “And his name shall be called
Angel of Great Counsel.”1
32.7. For Scripture also likens this one to be an angel of
God. For it was he himself who reported to us the mysteries
of the Father. 32.8. This one descended into the furnace with
those who were around Azariah. 32.9. The fire, seeing this
Angel, recognized his master and, being afraid, fled outside of
the furnace and on account of this rose forty-nine cubits. For
having been driven from within it gushed out and became
delicate dew, which whistled as a wind in the midst of the
furnace, from within, which did not at all possess the
fragrance of fire. 32.10. For the angel, who was standing in
the furnace, drove the flame outside from within and having
driven it he dispersed it in a circle around the furnace for fortynine cubits.
33.1. Then Nebuchadnezzar seeing what happened “was
amazed and rose up in haste and he heard their hymns and he
said to his nobles2
 ‘Did we not cast three men bound into the
midst of the fire?’ But they said, ‘Truly O king.’ He
answered and said, ‘Here I indeed see four men speaking and
walking in the midst of the fire and there is no destruction in
them and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of God.’”3
33.2. Tell me, Nebuchadnezzar, for when did you see the
Son of God, so that you confessed this one to be the Son of
God? Who pricked your heart so that you plainly spoke such
a word? With what sort of eyes were you able to see the light
of him4
? 33.3. But why was this shown to you alone and to

none of the other satraps? But it is because it is said, “the
heart of the king is in the hand of God.”1
33.4. The hand of God itself, the very thing which was
the Word, pricked the heart of the king2
, so that you may
recognize this one in the furnace and may glorify him. 33.5.
And this is not to be idly understood by us. For when the
sons of Israel, seeing the Son of God in the world, were
destined to not believe, Scripture proved that the nations
were destined to recognize him in the flesh3
, when long ago
Nebuchadnezzar seeing him not of flesh, observed him in the
furnace and confessed him to be a son of God.
34.1. “Then Nebuchadnezzar came to the door of the
burning furnace and he said, “Shadrach, Meshach and
Abednego, slaves of God Most High, come out and come
here.”4

34.2. For since he himself was not able to come into the
furnace, he called them to come outside. 34.3. And he called
the names of the three, but he found he was not able to declare
the fourth. For Jesus had not yet been born5
 of the virgin.
34.4.“And the satraps and captains and governors and
princes of the king came together and they saw the men, that
the fire did not have lordship of their body and the hair of
their head was not burned and their cloaks were not
worsened and the scent of fire was not in them.”6

35.1. But someone will likely say, “And so why did God
rescue the martyrs long ago, but now he does not so rescue
them?” 35.2. For twice we find that the blessed Daniel,
having been cast into the den of lions1
, was not destroyed by
the beasts and the three boys in the furnace were not
conquered by the fire.
35.3. Take heed, O man, because even at that time God
rescued whom he wished to still live, so that the magnificent
work of God may be shown and it may be preached in all the
world until now. 35.4. But whom he wishes to testify, he,
having crowned them, takes them. 35.5. For he rescued the
three boys, so that the boast of Nebuchadnezzar may be
shown as being nothing, wishing to demonstrate this, that
“what is impossible for men is possible for God.”2
 For since
Nebuchadnezzar was arrogant and said, “And who is the god
who is able to rescue you from the furnace of fire?”
3
 God
demonstrated to him that he is able to rescue his slaves
whenever he wills.
35.6. For also similarly it happened to Daniel, for after
Darius said, “Is God whom you perpetually serve, able to
rescue you from the mouths of the lions?”4
 Daniel answered
and said, “God sent his angel and he stopped the mouths of
the lions and they did not hurt me.”5
35.7. For also all the
governors and satraps contrived a pretext, so that they
handed Daniel over to the beasts in order to kill him. But God,
seeing their machinations and the sincerity of the blessed
Daniel, rescued him from the mouths of the lions, so that he
rescues whom he wills but takes whom he wills.
35.8. For we find also the seven martyrs who, under
Antiochus, endured terrible punishments and were taken
from the world. And so what of it? Was God not able to

smite king Antiochus and to rescue the seven brothers? He
was able, but he did not will to do this so that this example1
may become ours. 35.9. For if he rescued everyone, who
would he destine to testify? But if all were testifying and were
killed, he would be reckoned by some of the faithless as being
this: a powerless God.
36.1. And so it is necessary for a man to not resist the
plan of God. “For if we live, we live to the Lord; and if we
die, we die to the Lord. Whether we live or we die, we are of
the Lord.”2

36.2. He rescued Jonah from the belly of the sea monster
when he willed. 36.3. And he rescued Peter from the hand of
Herod and led him out of prison because he wished for him
to still live. In time3
 he took him who was crucified on behalf
of the name, when he himself willed. 36.4. He rescued Paul
from many dangers because he willed. After a time he took
him who was beheaded and this happened when he willed.
36.5. He permitted Stephen to be stoned by the Jews, but he
crowned him who endured.
36.6. How do you today delay to testify when those who
first, after testifying, were blessed? 36.7. And so you have in
an ancient testament many who have testified, yet many also
who were rescued, so that one and the same God is
demonstrated both long ago and now who also has authority
to do to his slaves the very thing which he wills.
36.8. But let us also go to him the King of Glory and let
us speak concerning the Son of God. Was God not able to
rescue his Christ, so that he may not be betrayed by the Jews?
Yes he was able, but he allowed him to suffer so that we,
through the cross of his death4
, may live. And on account of

this the Lord seeing the plan of God, said, “Father not my
will, but yours be done.”1
37.1. But what is better for you O man, having testified to
depart from this world in glory, or having been rescued here
and waiting patiently to keep sinning?2
37.2. For we have seen
many who have confessed before the tribunal who were,
through some pretext against the design of God, destroyed,
and we have seen they who lived a sufficient time and being
found in transgressions, also were destroyed.
37.3. How does a confession to God aid them? For it is
better for them rather that they are taken from this world as
pure, having a heavenly crown, then remaining here to heap
up sins for themselves concerning which they have to render
an account. 37.4. Therefore let the one who is brought forth
on account of the Name pray that at some time having
testified in such a way, to depart. For this one will never in
any way be judged, but he will judge “having his own share in
the first resurrection.”3
37.5. And so be firm O man, never stammering in faith,
and whenever you are called to testify4
 obey willingly, so that
your faith may be shown. It has happened that God has
tested you as he tested Abraham, when he demanded Isaac.
Having been brought forward, perhaps5
 he wills to deliver
you, and in this you glorify God.
37.6. And you mimic the three boys and understand their
faith! For they said to the king, “God is able to release us, but
if he does not will, we are under the authority of God, we
would rather gladly die than do what is prescribed by you.”6

37.7. Whom then Nebuchadnezzar also seeing the pure and
blameless boys coming out from the furnace was astounded
and amazed. For neither was their hair singed nor their cloaks
changed nor was the smell of fire in them.
38.1. And so in this way Nebuchadnezzar said, “‘Blessed
be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who sent
his angel and rescued his boys because they obeyed him and
they opposed1
 the word of the king and handed their bodies
over to the furnace, that they might not serve any God except
their God. And I have set out a decree: ‘All people, tribes,
and tongues who shall ever speak blasphemy against the God
of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be destroyed and
their houses shall be plundered, because there is no other
God who is able to rescue in this way.’ And he prospered2
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the country of Babylon
and strengthened them and promoted them to lead all the
Jews who were in his kingdom.”3
38.2. And so it is necessary to observe, beloved, how faith
towards God pours out such great grace.4
38.3. For even as
they handed themselves over to death, they glorified God
himself, in this way again they also were not only glorified by
God but also by the king and they taught the tribes and the
barbarian nations to revere God.
38.4. For this truly happens to befall us even now, for
when one of the saints is called to martyrdom and
magnificent things are done5
 by God for him, immediately all
who see wonder, and many believe through the signs and in
this way they also become martyrs of God. 38.5. To whom we
also have believed, so let us also inspire ourselves to be worthy
before God, being chaste in body, soul, and spirit, so that we

Book 3
Concerning Nebuchadnezzar and
concerning Daniel when he was
thrown to the lions
Nebuchadnezzar’s vision of the great tree
1.1. “Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all peoples, tribes, and
tongues who dwell upon the earth. Peace to you be
multiplied. The signs and wonders which God did with me,
it is good for me to declare to you as they are great and
powerful. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and his
authority is from generation to generation. I,
Nebuchadnezzar, was flourishing in my house and
prospering. I saw a dream and it frightened me and I was
troubled upon my bed and the visions of my head confused
me. And I set forth a decree1
 to bring before me all the wise
men of Babylon, so that they may make known the
interpretation of the dream to me. And the magicians,
soothsayers, and Chaldeans came in. And I myself spoke the
dream before them and they did not make its interpretation
known to me until one who came, Daniel, the name of whom
was Baltasar according to the name of my God, who has the
Holy Spirit of God in him. To whom I said ‘Baltasar, chief of
the enchanters, I myself know that the Holy Spirit of God is
in you and every mystery is not impossible for you, hear the
dream which I saw and tell me its interpretation.’”2

2.1. And so at that time Nebuchadnezzar, after seeing the
marvels which happened to the three boys and being pricked
in heart, set forth through a decree to publically announce to
all peoples, tribes, and tongues who were under him, that
namely they who hear what occurred, should fear God and
should glorify him, just as he himself also praised God and said,
“His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and his authority is
from generation to generation.”1

2.2. Then he described what happened in his second
vision, as none of the magicians, soothsayers, and Chaldeans
were able to declare the matter to the king, until Daniel was
called who also described to Nebuchadnezzar2
 his first vision,
so that in all things God might glorify his own slaves the
prophets beyond the other barbarians and foreign nations,
who pretend to be flattered in their human wisdom, having
practiced earthly learning. 2.3. For grace and gifts are from
above from God, they are from heaven, which furnish their
wealth to the worthy, which the blessed prophets partake by
the Holy Spirit and are always made to understand.
2.4. Just as also the apostle wrote to the Corinthians
saying, “And I myself came to you not proclaiming words
which are taught by human wisdom, but proclaiming to you the
mystery of Christ, rather in words taught by the Spirit,
interpreting spiritual things with spiritual things.”3
2.5. And so
in this way also the earthly wisdom of all the wise men in
Babylon became foolish, who were not able to interpret the
dream of the king, until one came, named Daniel, who had the
Holy Spirit of God in him, just as the king himself also
testified and proved it in many ways, and he set it forth to the
people4
 in writing, so that not only would Daniel5
 be shown
as being honored by the king himself, but also by all who

were subjected to the king, so that he may be named as a man
of God and a great prophet.
2.6. Just as also the Egyptians, who long ago saw the
wonderful works in the ten plagues which came upon them
through Moses, were afraid and so they named him
Mennouthim, which is in Egyptian, “Man of God.” For
“Mennou” is called man, and “Thim” is called God. And in
this way Nebuchadnezzar testified concerning Daniel that,
“he has the Holy Spirit of God in him.”1
3.1. Then after he was called and stood before the king,
the king answered him, “I was looking upon my bed, and
behold, a tree in the midst of the earth and its height was
great. The tree grew and was strong and its height reached
unto heaven, and its trunk to the limits of all the earth. Its
leaves were seasonable and its fruit was plentiful and the food
in it was for all. The wild beasts sheltered under it and in its
branches settled the birds of heaven and from it all flesh was
nurtured. I saw in the vision of the night upon my bed, and
behold, a watcher and a holy one descended from heaven and
spoke in strength and he said, ‘Cut down the tree and strip its
branches and shake off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the
beasts be loosed from under it and the birds from its
branches, except leave the stump of its roots in the earth and
in a bronze and iron bond and it shall lie outside in the grass
and in the dew of heaven and its portion shall be with the
beasts and in the grass of the earth. His heart shall be
changed from men and a heart of a beast shall be given to
him and seven seasons shall pass over him. This word is
through the judgment of the watcher and the matter through
the sanction of a holy one, so that all who live may know that
the Most High reigns over the kingdom of men and he shall
give it to whomever he esteems, and he shall raise up upon it

the contemptible1
 of men.’ I, Nebuchadnezzar the king, saw
this dream and you Baltasar spoke its interpretation, because
all the wise men of my kingdom were not able to explain its
interpretation to me, but you Daniel were able because a holy
spirit is in you.”2
4.1. The dream which was seen by Nebuchadnezzar was
displayed as a punishment for the king himself, whose heart
was exalted and lifted up against God, having set up a golden
image and having forced all to be idolaters, it was shown to
him through a vision that even he might see that he has the lot
of being under the authority of God, even if he seems to at
some time reign over all the kings of the earth.
4.2. And so that it may be shown that the kingdom which
was given to him was from God, Daniel said to him, “You O
king, are a king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has
given a strong and powerful and honorable kingdom in every
place where the sons of men dwell.”3
4.3. And the king
himself, having been amazed at the dream which Daniel
interpreted, spoke similarly, “In truth your God, he is God of
gods and Lord of lords because he is able to reveal this
mystery.”4
4.4. And so when he forgot the first matters and he was
later arrogantly lifted up, he received this punishment from
God as an example and a model which was meant for all
human tyrants and kings5
, so as they who think they are
above man may not brag, and that they who are lifted up may
not boast against God, but they may foresee their danger and
may fear God, seeing that they also have a Lord in the
heavens.

4.5. For also Antiochus who was called Epiphanes, who
became the king of Syria, who tortured the slaves of God
with various torments, and having undertaken baser things at
last even he came upon1
 the deserved retribution from God
and was punished with divine scourges, and he was not even
able to endure his own stench, but while he was still living,
worms swarmed from his impious eyes, and though proclaiming
many entreaties and confessions to God, his salvation did
come upon him. 4.6. Who also having despaired of himself
and coming to the knowledge of the rest of mankind, when
he was about to die he spoke in this way, “It is just to be
subject to God, and a man who is mortal should not consider
himself equal to gods.”2
4.7. So that as many kings reverently and God-lovingly
are turned back from sin, these also are honored by God, but
as many are lifted up in accordance with their pride, these
receive deserved and righteous retribution from God. 4.8. In
which manner also Sennacherib, who boasted of his own
great might and reproached God with lying words, was struck
by an angel and on one night, one hundred eighty five
thousand were destroyed. Later he himself also was done
away with by his sons in his own land, according to the word
of the Lord which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, so
that all men may know the heavenly authority.
5.1. And so similarly it happened also to Nebuchadnezzar.
For indeed after he began the eighteenth year, he set up the
image, just as has been said in the book before this, and its
dimensions3
 were also made known. After the year with
twelve months was fulfilled, his kingdom was taken away
from him so that the dream which was seen by him was
fulfilled and he who had captured others, himself became a

fugitive, and he who punished the Hebrews in a strange land,
even he was deservedly punished in a desolate land.
5.2. Just as Scripture instructs saying, “Then Daniel, who
was Baltasar in name, was astounded for about one hour, and
his thoughts confused him. And Baltasar answered and said,
‘Lord, let the dream be upon those who hate you and its
interpretation upon your enemies. The tree which you saw,
which grew great and strong, the height of which reached
unto heaven and its trunk to all the earth and its leaves
flourished and its fruit was plentiful and the food in it was for
all, under it dwelt the wild beasts and in its branches the birds
of heaven sheltered, you are the tree, O king, because you have
been magnified and made strong, and your magnificence has
been magnified and has reached unto heaven and your
dominion to the limits of the earth. And because the king
saw a watcher and a holy one descending from heaven who1
said, ‘Strip the tree and destroy it, except leave the stump of
its roots in the earth, and in a bronze and iron bond and it
shall lie2
 outside in the grass and the dew of heaven and its
portion shall be with the wild beasts, until seven seasons shall
pass over it.’ This is its interpretation, O king, and the
judgment is of the Most High, which has come upon my lord
the king. And they shall drive you from men and your
dwelling shall be with the wild beasts, and they will feed you
with grass as an ox, and you shall lie3
 under the dew of
heaven, and seven seasons shall pass over you, until you
know that the Most High rules over the kingdom of men, and
he shall give it to whomever he esteems. And when he said,
‘Leave the stump of the roots of the tree,’ your kingdom will
remain for you, until4
 you know the authority of heaven. On
account of this, O king, let my counsel please you and redeem

your sins in alms and your unrighteous deeds by pity on the
poor. Perhaps he will be patient upon your trespasses.’ All
these things came upon Nebuchadnezzar the king. After
twelve months when he was walking in the temple of his
kingdom in Babylon the king answered and said, ‘Is this
Babylon not great, which I myself built as a house for my
kingdom, for the rule of my strength, for the honor of my
glory?’ While the word was still in the mouth of the king a
voice from heaven rang out1
, saying, ‘To you
Nebuchadnezzar the king, your kingdom has passed from
you and they shall banish you from men and your dwelling
shall be with the wild beasts and they will feed you grass as an
ox and seven seasons shall pass over you, until2
 you know
that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and he shall
give it to whomever he esteems.’ In the same hour the word
was accomplished upon Nebuchadnezzar and he was
banished from men and ate grass as an ox and his body was
bathed by the dew of heaven, until his hair grew like a lion’s
and his nails became like a bird’s. And after the end of the
days, I Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven and my
wits returned to me and I blessed the Most High and praised
and glorified him who lives forever, because his authority is
an eternal authority and his kingdom is from generation to
generation and all who dwell upon the earth are reckoned as
nothing, and according to his will he does in the power of
heaven and in the dwelling of the earth, and there is not one
who shall stand against his hand and will say to him, ‘What
have you done?’’”3
6.1. And so the dream seems to be self evident and quite
clear to all, just as Scripture also teaches that these things
happened in this way, and the same king later, while

confessing, described what occurred to him. 6.2. But at all
events the grace of God plentifully causes man to understand,
so that we, having in all things an unhindered mind, may not
devote ourselves to the persons of human kings, for hope in
man is vain, let us not, for the sake of gifts, flatter rulers who
being in authority marshal men, but rather adhering to God
alone and doing what is pleasing to him, let us also now
continue in the present less dangerous life1
 and let us readily
flee from the judgment which is to come.
6.3. For how is a king and a ruler able to aid a man, since
he is also mortal and is moved by the same authority of he
who made all things? 6.4. For he is able in this life to furnish to
you many great gifts, but even these are earthly and happen to
also be temporary.
6.5. But many obtain honor and gifts under the king and
are appointed into some authorities, later however, they
endanger themselves either being found as plotters, or done
away with by others as being friends of the king. 6.6. How
does friendship with the king aid them, who were not satiated
with gifts which they received, but also besides destroy their
own souls?
6.7. And so flee such persons2
, O man, never endangering
yourself on account of them, “for all flesh is grass and all the
glory of men is as the flower of the field3
. The grass withers
and the flower falls.”4
6.8. Hear what was spoken by the
apostle Paul, how he advises Timothy, writing, “Proclaim to
the wealthy in5
 the present age not to be high-minded, nor to
obey the uncertainty of wealth, but to hope in the living

God,1
 who is the Savior of all men who exceedingly believe.”2
7.1. For if the glory of those who lie in3
 prominence is like
dry leaves, which blossom for a little while but immediately
waste away, how does it aid Nebuchadnezzar the king when
he says this immoderate statement, “Is this Babylon not great,
which I myself built as a house for my kingdom, for the rule
of my strength, for the honor of my glory?”4
 When after he
was banished, he ate vegetation with the beasts in the
mountains?
7.2. How does that insolence and the mighty arrogance of
words and the great and terrible flame of the furnace aid
Nebuchadnezzar when he is not master5
 of his own soul? 7.3.
And on account of this the blessed Daniel became his
counselor, like a good doctor who wishes to heal his hurts.
Now he said, “Let my counsel please you and redeem your
sins in alms and your unrighteous deeds by pity on the poor.
Perhaps he will be patient upon your trespasses.”6
7.4. Therefore he, who also interpreted the dream of the
king, was grieved and became tearful and for about one hour
was amazed and his thoughts troubled him, not wishing to
send out his voice, indicating the affection which he had for
the king, so that in this even the king7
 was sorely pricked and
when he did what was spoken by the prophet, he was able to
be saved.
7.5. And so after Daniel stood voiceless for one hour and
was greatly silent, he, while looking at everyone, was confused
by his thoughts and his face was changed, and Daniel8
 became

became pale on account of the fear of the interpretation, lest
the king, having heard what was spoken concerning him,
become angered and command him to be killed; but when he
was empowered by the Spirit and assumed the face of an
angel, his appearance became fiery and his eyes shining as a
flame of fire, so that in this the king, being astounded, was
afraid.
7.6. For if the sons of Israel were not able to look upon
the face of the blessed Moses on account of the glory of his
face, how then were the Babylonians not afraid who looked at
the face of Daniel which had changed? Certainly when he
appeared as a man they were not afraid, but when he was also
shown as an angel of God, they were afraid.
7.7. Then having been calmed from great vision and
agony and coming to his own state of human nature, he
answered the king and said, “Let, O king, the dream be upon
those who hate you and its judgment on your enemies.”1
7.8.
And in this way, having begun, he proclaimed to him
according to each thing which was to happen to him and
encouraged him with comforting words and he again restored
his hopes for what was about to be. 7.9. For he says to him,
“And when the king saw a watcher and a holy one descending
from heaven who2
 said, ‘Cut down the tree and strip its leaves
leaves and shake its branches except leave the stump of the
roots of the tree in the earth.’ 3 Your kingdom will remain, O
king, until you know the heavenly authority, because the Most
High rules the kingdom of men and he shall give it to whom
he wills.”4
8.1. And so after twelve months all these things happened
to king Nebuchadnezzar. 8.2. For neither did Scripture lie nor

93
did Daniel deceive him, but he taught him beforehand that
these things were about to be accomplished in him.
8.3. For the tree “grew great and strong, which reached
unto the height of heaven and its trunk to the limits of all the
earth,”1
 Scripture indicates it to be the kingdom of
Nebuchadnezzar, as also Daniel distinctly stated, because the
king was exalted and became glorious and ruled over all the
earth and mastered the farthest nations. 8.4. Its branches
were dignitaries and commanders and governors and all who
were appointed by him were as branches which are put forward
from a tree. 8.5. The leaves of the tree represent the edicts
through his words, which he sent to all the earth, bidding and
appointing just as he planned.
8.6. The tree which has great fruit is clearly the great
revenue and tribute which was brought up to him from each2
of the nations. 8.7. Its trunk which sits upon the earth signals
it to be the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar on account of it being
engaged in earthly matters, just as it is established over the
earth. 8.8. The great fruit of it and the food for all, which is in
it, signal the salaries and honors and favors which are given to
all by the king, which were like food from a tree which is
given to men. 8.9. The wild beasts which dwell under it are
signaled to be the armies and the powers which always stand
near and remain in service to the king, assisting to the utmost
for what has been ordered, like wild beasts who are ready to
battle and to destroy and to rend men in pieces as if they were3
beasts.4
8.10. The birds which dwell in its branches are the
obedience of all the nations to him, who come distantly and
from afar and submit to those who are appointed chiefs by
him, just as branches originate from the tree.

Nebucahdnezzar banished
9.1. And so when the angel came down from heaven and
said, “Cut down the tree and strip its branches and shake off
its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the beasts be loosed from
under it and the birds from its branches”1
, this indicates the
occurrence of a plot by the satraps against the king and by
those who are in power under them.
9.2. After he was banished by them, he fled to the desert
and his kingdom and the authority and majesty which he had
formerly were taken, because he boasted and said, “Who is the
god, who shall take you from my hands?”2
 Later stooping
piteously to the earth, and wailing in the mountains, he lived
with the beasts, fearing his satraps, lest he be killed by them.
9.3. And on account of this Scripture says, “He shall lie
outside in the grass and in the dew of heaven and with the
beasts and his portion shall be in the grass of the earth. His
heart shall be changed from men and a heart of a beast shall
be given to him.”3
9.4. For no longer did the great king and
ruler live as a man administering the kingdom, but being
alone in the desert he ate grass and herbs until his heart was
changed and became as a beast who lived4
 in forests and
caverns, until his hair grew as a lion’s and his nails grew large
as a bird’s and seven seasons passed over him.”5
9.5. For in this way God the Most High interpreted6
 these
these things to be, just as Daniel says, “The judgment is of
the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king.”7

9.6. The Word, having heard the council of the Father,
descended from heaven to proclaim the will of the Father
through angels 1
, as Scripture says, “A holy one descended
from heaven.”2
9.7. The angels consulted the Word, “What does the
master command us?” For this is the request of the saints.
9.8. The word to them was that God the Most High says this,
“Cut down the tree and strip its branches and shake its
leaves.”3
9.9. Those who heard this routed the powers of the
king, so that they took away his kingdom. 9.10. For all the
nations were handed over to the angels, as John says in the
Apocalypse, “And I heard one saying, ‘Release the four angels
who reside on the great river Euphrates’”4
 who are Persians,
Medes, Assyrians, and Babylonians.
10.1. Next Scripture says, “And he shall lie outside in the
grass and in the dew of heaven and seven seasons shall pass
over him until you know that God the Most High rules over
the kingdom of men.”5
10.2. And so some count seven
seasons as seven years. But some take6
 seven seasons to refer
to three months for each year, for one year has four seasons,
winter, spring, summer, and autumn, as seven seasons then
are given7
 to the king. 10.3. For when it says to him, “Leave
the stump of the roots of the tree in the earth,”8
 it is clear that
that he is again according to the purpose of God about to be
reestablished over his own office. 10.4. For this occurred as
an education for the king, so that he would not be high-

minded and in the future he would be able to say, “And all
who walk arrogance are able to be humbled.”1
11.1. And so we find in the records that Nebuchadnezzar
reigned twenty-five years. 11.2. For after he reigned the first
eighteen years, then after being lifted up, he set up the image.
Then after twelve months this happened to him and he was
banished from men and his kingdom was taken from him.
11.3. And when he humbled himself and begged the Lord and
confessed and entreated God the Most High, he was sought
by his magistrates and having returned, he reigned again for
seven years.
11.4. Just as he himself also described saying, “And after
the end of the days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to
heaven and my thoughts2
 returned to me and I blessed the
Most High and praised and glorified him who lives forever,
because his authority is an eternal authority and his kingdom
is from generation to generation and all who dwell upon the
earth are reckoned as nothing, and according to his will he
does in the power of heaven and in the dwelling of the earth,
and there is not anyone who shall stand against his hand and
will say to him, ‘What have you done?’ In the same season my
thoughts3
 returned to me and I came into the honor of my
kingdom. And my form returned to me and my princes and
my magistrates sought me, and I was strengthened over my
kingdom and extravagant majesty was added to me. And so
now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King
of Heaven, because all his works are true and his paths are just
judgments and all who walk in arrogance are able to be
humbled.”4

11.5. When he put away the same great arrogance which
he acquired, and when he was suffering in the mountains, he
confessed to God, recognizing the heavenly authority and he
was restored again to the office of his kingdom, after both the
magistrates and princes and all of those who were under him
sought him, they also bestowed extravagant honor and glory
upon him, so that what was spoken in the vision was fulfilled,
“Except leave the stump of the roots of the tree in the earth,
until you know that the Most High reigns over the kingdom
of men and he shall give it to whom he esteems.”1
12.1. And so the kind of things which happened to
Nebuchadnezzar at that time in the those seasons were for
admonitions and reminders, and were recorded for all men, as
Daniel, also in dreams and visions2
, really described these
things as happening, concerning which if we approach upon
the passage in the book, we may interpret both the dreams and
visions and shall show these to also be true.
12.2. For Nebuchadnezzar saw two dreams: the dream of
the many colored image, then the dream concerning the tree,
which Daniel interpreted, and in due time it was fulfilled.
12.3. Likewise that which Daniel also saw, the four beasts
rising from the sea, some of whom have already been, some
of whom shall be, so that we may demonstrate that the
prophecy of Daniel is the same and equal as the rest, differing
in nothing, in order to make a proof of the things which already
were and are and again shall be.
12.4. For if we believe the things which have already been
as true, how do we not believe that all the coming events will
be true also, which the blessed prophets announced
beforehand that they shall be? But all things have been fulfilled,
emerging in their own times according to the purpose of
God.

Belshazzar violates the holy vessels of the temple of God
13.1. And so we see what Scripture says, “Belshazzar1
 the
king made a great feast for his thousand magistrates, and wine
was before them, and Belshazzar was drinking and when he
tasted the wine, he said to bring in the golden and silver
vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father brought from the
Temple which is in Jerusalem, that the king and his
magistrates and his mistresses and his concubines might drink
from them. And the golden and silver vessels were brought
in, which Nebuchadnezzar his father brought out from the
temple of God which is in Jerusalem, and the king and his
magistrates and his mistresses and his concubines drank from
them. They drank wine and praised the golden and silver and
bronze and iron and wooden and stone gods. In that same
hour, fingers of a man's hand came forth, and they wrote
before the lamp2
 upon the plaster of the wall of the house of
the king, and the king saw the knuckles of the hand which
wrote. Then the form of the king was changed and his
thoughts confused him and the union of his loins was parted
and his knees struck. And the king shouted in strength to
bring in magicians3
, Chaldeans, and soothsayers. And he said
to the wise men of Babylon, ‘Whoever shall read this writing
and make known to me its interpretation, shall be clothed in
purple and a golden necklace shall be upon his neck and he
shall rule as third in my kingdom.’ And all the wise men of the
king came in and they were not able to read the writing nor

make known to the king the interpretation. And Belshazzar
was disturbed and his form was changed and his magistrates
were troubled.”1
14.1. And so after the death of Nebuchadnezzar his son
Evil Merodoch succeeded to his kingdom, of whom the
Scripture2
 does not mention, surely because he lived
reverently, surely because there was nothing monstrous in
him3
. 14.2. He reigned twelve years and after him his brother
Belshazzar reigned, concerning whom Scripture now makes a
narrative. 14.3. He made a great supper for his thousand
magistrates in the fourth year of his kingdom.
14.4. While they were drunk, the king, being puffed up4
,
commanded that the golden and silver vessels, which
Nebuchadnezzar his father had brought out from the Temple
which was in Jerusalem, to be brought forth, that the
magistrate and his mistresses may drink from them. Those
vessels, which were dedicated to God for his glory and honor
by other kings, they took with defiled hands, and made a drink
offering in them and praised the lifeless and motionless idols.
14.5. Accordingly after this happened, fingers of a man's hand
came forth, and they wrote before the lamp upon the plaster
of the wall of the house of the king.
14.6. In the case of Nebuchadnezzar it said, “A holy one
descended from heaven,”5
 here it says, “fingers of a hand
came forth,”6
 Scripture signaling that this is the same Word
which was about to be embodied in the end and to assume
the figure of a man, so that he may never be looked at as
through a form, but having become a man in the flesh and
the will of the Father having dwelt with men, he is perfected.

14.7. And so when the hand1
 wrote writing on the wall,
Scripture, in this, indicates this to be the law of God which
was engraved on the mountain in tablets. As Scripture says,
“and the tablets were written by the finger of God”2
 and “the
writing was the writing of God which was engraved on the
tablets.”3
14.8. And so in this way also here, the fingers of a hand
were shown to the king alone, which flashed before the lamp,
so that what was written there may be considered to be the
writing of God. 14.9. For the light of the hand, after dazzling
the light of the lamp, dimmed the light of the lamp4
, so that
the fingers which wrote on the wall might be seen.
15.1. When the king saw this he quaked in fear5
 and was
in much distress, and he shouted in strength to bring in
magicians, Chaldeans and soothsayers, not knowing that it is
not possible for these to read the letters of God, but it is
possible for those who from childhood practiced the law of
God who also recognize the divine letters from their fathers.
15.2. And so after all were called, the king said to them,
“‘Whoever shall read this writing and make known to me its
interpretation, shall be clothed in purple and a golden
necklace shall be upon his neck and he shall rule as third in my
kingdom.’ “And all the wise men of the king came in and they
were not able to read the writing nor make known to the king
the interpretation.”6

15.3. For then how many of the Babylonians were there
who wanted to please the king and were contriving many ways
to forge some strange phrase and be clothed in purple and be
glorified in the third throne? But the phrase was hidden from

them. For their eyes were dull and the perceptions of their
hearts were incapacitated. For the Lord knows the thoughts
of the wise, that they are empty.1
15.4. And so while they were
begging2
, the heart of the king was disturbed and his form
was changed and his magistrates were troubled.
15.5. Then at this point, “the queen, having heard what
happened, came into the house of the drinking bout and said
to the king, ‘Let not your thoughts trouble you, and let not
your form be changed. There is a man in your kingdom in
whom is the Spirit of God, and in the days of your father
watchfulness and understanding were found in him. And
king Nebuchadnezzar your father set him as chief of the
enchanters, magicians, Chaldeans, and soothsayers. Because
the Spirit of God abounds in him and thoughts and
understanding are his, he interprets dreams and explains
difficulties, and solves riddles3
; his name is Daniel. And the
king gave4
him the name Baltasar. And so now let him be
called and he will explain the interpretation to you.’”5
16.1. And so for what reason did the queen enter and call
to mind Daniel? For did all the magistrates and friends of the
king not know him? Or did they not know the things which
occurred to Nebuchadnezzar, as he alone saw6
 the dreams
which were meant for him7
, and he set him as chief of the wise
men of Babylon? 16.2. They themselves also knew, but being
destroyed by him, since he was adorned with heavenly
wisdom, they did not want to proclaim to the king concerning

102
him, so that he might not come and interpret1
 the writing, and
later they would be shamed.
16.3. This not only happened to Daniel then, but also
even now it occurs to many. 16.4. For when one of the saints
acquires grace from God and is found wiser than others,
immediately everyone begins coveting, hating, persecuting,
insulting2
, dishonoring, talking down3
, and setting him at
naught, so that by this they imagine him to be nothing. 16.5.
For similarly it also happened upon the prophets and upon
the Lord and upon the apostles. In this way also we observe
these things coming upon Daniel in Babylon. For Scripture
puts forth these things as a proof that they happened in this
way.
17.1. Then accordingly after the king heard the things
concerning him he commanded Daniel to be brought and he
said to him, “Are you Daniel who is from the sons of the
captivity of Judea, whom my father Nebuchadnezzar
brought? I have heard concerning you that you are able to
interpret questions. And so now if you are able to read this
writing and to make known its interpretation to me you shall
be clothed in purple and a golden necklace shall be upon your
neck and you shall be the third position4
 in my kingdom.”5
17.2. But the blessed Daniel, not taking pleasure in earthly
gifts nor being lifted up at kingly glory answered, “Let your
gifts, O king, be to you and give the present of your house to
another. But I shall read the writing and I shall make known
the interpretation to you.”6
17.3. And in this way, having begun, he described to the
king all the things which happened to his father in their order,

103
and at the same time he thoroughly explained to him the things
which happened, in order to cause1
 him to understand not to
brag, nor to be arrogant, but that one must be under the
authority of God.
17.4. And so he said to him, “God Most High gave to
Nebuchadnezzar your father the kingdom and the majesty
and the honor and the glory. And from the majesty which
was given to him all peoples, tribes, and tongues were
trembling and fearing from his face. Whom he wished, he
did away with and whom he wished he struck and whom he
wished he exalted and whom he wished he humbled. And
when his heart was lifted up and his spirit was determined to
act arrogantly, he was thrown down from the throne of his
kingdom and honor was taken from him. And he was
banished from men and his heart was given with beasts and
his dwelling with the wild asses, they fed him grass like an ox,
and from the dew of heaven his body was bathed, until he
knew that the Most High reigns over the kingdom of men
and he shall give it to whomever he esteems.”2
17.5. And after saying these things he added the following,
at once rebuking the king and not receiving his face so that
having heard this the king3
 would be afraid and so that he who
committed trespasses might immediately recognize them.
17.6. And so it says, “And you his son, Belshazzar, you
have not humbled your heart before God; do you not know
all these things? And you have been exalted4
 against the Lord
God of heaven and have brought the vessels of his house
before you and you and your magistrates and your mistresses
and your concubines drank wine from them, and you have
praised golden and silver and bronze and iron and wooden
and stone gods, which do not see and which do not hear and

which do not understand, and God, of whom your breath is
in his hand and all your ways are as well, you have not glorified
him. On account of this the fingers1
 of a hand have been
sent from his face and he ordered this writing: ‘Mane, Thekel,
Fares.’ This is the interpretation of the phrase: ‘Mane,’ God
has measured your kingdom and ended it2
, ‘Thekel,’ it has
been weighed in the balance and been found wanting, ‘Fares,’
your kingdom is divided and has been given to the Medes and
Persians.”3
18.1. For the king, after he heard the writing and its
interpretation, was grieved at what was spoken, but he
commanded Daniel to be clothed in purple and to be the
third position4
 in the kingdom. 18.2. In the same night king
Belshazzar the Chaldean was killed and Darius the Mede
received the kingdom being sixty-two years old.
5
18.3. After the interpretation had been solved by Daniel,
just as Scripture encompasses all things, in the same night the
phrase was fulfilled and the kingdom of the Babylonians
passed to the Medes, just as was spoken by Daniel, “He
appoints kings and removes them knowing what is in darkness
and light is with him”6
Darius casts Daniel into the lion’s den
19.1. And so Darius, who was called Ahasuerus7
, received
the kingdom and “appointed one-hundred-twenty satraps and
appointed three governors over them, whom Daniel was one
of, for the satraps to give account that the king may not be

105
overburdened. And Daniel was over them because a spirit
abounded in him1
, and the king appointed him over his whole
kingdom.”2
19.2. For Darius the Mede, after hearing the things
concerning him, both the wisdom which he acquired and his
faith and piety from childhood, he appointed him to be first
of all his friends and to rule all his kingdom, as Pharaoh did,
having granted to Joseph second honor of the throne of his
kingdom and assigning all the chiefs of the Egyptians to be
obedient to him.
19.3. Accordingly, after this happened, the governors and
satraps were stirred with jealousy and sought to find a pretext
against Daniel, so that they might take some occasion against
him and accuse him and kill him. In which manner the word
was fulfilled, which we spoke a little before, that a pious man
or one who fears God and has grace and wisdom from God is
hated by the rest of men because they also were not honored
with the same gift. 19.4. In this way also the satraps and
governors through envy hated Daniel since he was wiser and
more faithful than all of them were.
19.5. For Scripture testified to this, saying, “And not any
pretext and transgression and fault was found against him
because he was faithful.”3
19.6. For he not only kept the
commandments of God according to the law, but also the
prescriptions of the king with much diligence and his conduct
was exacting4
, wishing to stain his favor and pure conscience
in no sordid matter of little gain.
20.1. For then how many were they who pretended to be
friends with Daniel, who wickedly hated him in heart? They
falsely-sent gifts with other intentions5
 and they ordered to

give befitting gifts, wishing to test1
 his sincerity, in order to
have for the king a future pretext against him that they might
appeal to the king that he was obliging himself to the king’s
possessions, and he in this way be killed as a plotter.
20.2. And so at all times they resourcefully sought a cause
against him. And not finding anything they later deliberated
together, saying, “We have not found a pretext against Daniel
except in the laws of his God.”2
20.3. Then, having made one
decision, they came to the king and said, “Darius, O king, live
forever! Your captains and satraps and chiefs and governors
have deliberated to set up a royal statute over your kingdom
and to confirm an edict, that whoever asks a petition from
any God and man for thirty days except from you, O king,
shall be cast into the den of the lions. And so now O king,
set up the edict and set out a writing because3
 the decree of
the Persians and Medes shall not be changed.”4
20.4. Then
Darius, not perceiving the machination of theirs, purposed a
decision, he commended a decree to be written and it to be
put forth publicly. 20.5. For also later Haman wishing to kill
Mordecai and his race went to king Artaxerxes and deliberated
the same, that by royal decree on the fourteenth of the
twelfth month on that one day, all the Jews shall be killed.5

21.1. And so Daniel, when he knew what was written,
having reflected on the plot which came upon him, did not
fear it nor was terrified, but was readily holding himself to be
handed over as food for beasts rather than to obey the
prescription of the king. And he had a pattern of what
happened to the three youths, when they did not wish to bow
to the king’s image, and they were preserved from the furnace
of fire. 21.2. And then he, coming into his house, opened the

107
windows in the upper chambers opposite Jerusalem and three
times a day knelt upon his knees and praised and confessed
before his God just as he did before.1
22.1. And so it is needful to see the piety of the blessed
Daniel, how he did not2
 even pretend to be devoted to the
royal affairs but rather adhering in prayer each day he
rendered the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God
to God.
Hippolytus argues for martyrdom
22.2. But someone will perhaps say, “And so what of it?
Was he not able to pray by heart to God at day, but at night
as he wished, devote to prayer secretly in the house so that he
might not be endangered?” He was able but he did not want
to. 22.3. For if he did this the governors and satraps would
have to say, “How does he fear God when he fears the decree
of the king and what is commanded by him he obeys?” And
they would3
 bring against him some blame or4
 censure of
faithlessness. For this is a work of hypocrisy, not of fear and
faith to God.
22.4. And on account of this he did not give a pretext of
slander to those who opposed him, for whatever one is
subject to, by this he is also enslaved. 23.1. For those who
believe in God ought not to feign nor fear what is ordered of
them by authorities, lest they otherwise do some evil. If on
account of faith to God they are compelled to do some other
thing, they would gladly die rather than to do what is
commanded by them.
23.2. For when the apostle said to be subject to all who
are in authority5
, he does not speak concerning this, that we

deny our faith and deny what is prescribed by God, and that
we do these things which men command, instead the apostle said
that we should fear the authorities and not do evil1
, so that we
are not punished by them as evildoers. 23.3. And on account
of this he says, “He is a servant of God, an avenger upon
those who practice evil. What? Do you wish to not fear
authority?2
 He does good and you will have approval from
him. But if you do evil be afraid. For he does not bear the
sword in vain.”3
 So that according to this he said to be
subject, to live holily and piously in the present life, having
before your eyes the danger of the sword.
23.4. And so the apostles, being hindered by the chiefs
and scribes, were not prevented from speaking the word, and
obeyed God rather than men, and on account of this, having
vexed the authorities, they, “set them in public prison. But at
night an angel led them out and said, ‘Go speak the words of
this life.’”4
24.1. And so in this way Daniel also was hindered from
prayer and he did not submit to the decree of the king, so that
he may not place the glory of God under the glory of men.
24.2. For if on account of God someone dies, he ought to
rejoice, having found in this eternal life.
24.3. And so it is necessary for those who, with purity,
labor and live with fear in this world, to not give a pretext to
those who seek a pretext, so that in this they would rather be
disgraced. In which way then also the governors sought to
find pretext against Daniel and they did not find it, because
he was faithful.
24.4. But if some people constrain us to not revere God,
nor entreat him and threaten death to us, it is more happy to

1

 Or: do you not wish to fear authority?

109
die than to do what is commanded by them, “for what can
separate us from the love of God? Persecution or difficulty
or oppression or hunger or danger or sword?”1
24.5. And on
account of this the blessed Daniel feared God more and
handed himself over to death and he was preserved from the
lions by the angel. 24.6. For if he revered the decree and kept
quiet during the thirty days, his faith to God would never be
pure, for no one is able to serve two lords.
24.7. For the cunning of the devil is always like this, to
oppress and persecute and to maltreat saints, so that they may
not lift up holy hands while praying to God, seeing that the
prayer of the saints furnishes peace to the world but
punishment to the wicked. 24.8. Just as Moses also when he
lifted up hands in the desert, Israel prevailed, but whenever
he set them down, Amalek prevailed.2
24.9. Just as this
happens even now and is fulfilled among us. For whenever
we cease praying the adversary prevails against us, but
whenever we adhere to prayer, the power and authority of the
evil one is abolished.
Daniel is accused by the satraps
25.1. And so in this way even at that time the adversary3
operated in the governors and satraps, so that through them
he might accomplish his own will and cast the blessed Daniel
into the den of lions. 25.2. And whom they watched closely
and seeing him pray three times a day, came forth saying to
the king, “‘O king Darius, have you not appointed an edict
that any man who should ask from any god and man a
petition for thirty days except from you O king, shall be cast

into the den of lions?’ He said, ‘The word is true and the
decree of the Medes and the Persians shall not pass away.’”1
25.3. They said to him, “‘Behold, Daniel, who is from the
sons of the captivity of Judah, does not obey your decree and
three times a day he asks from his God his petitions.’ Then,
the king when he heard the matter, was greatly grieved over it
and he fought concerning Daniel in order to release him.”2
25.4. For having known their machinations and that they hated
Daniel because he was at that time wiser and more reputable
than all of them and that they devised this plot against him,
wanting to hand him over to beasts through a trap3
. Therefore
the king4
 questioned the satraps and asked whether he could
be able to preserve him from danger.
25.5. But it was so that he may not be rescued by man, and
his deliverance5
 not be considered to be by the favor of the
king, but rather that the work of God may be shown to be
accomplished in him. And so it was already evening and the
king was conversing on his behalf with the satraps when they
spoke saying, “Know, O king, that for the Medes and
Persians, the decree of every edict6
 and statute which the king
has set, may not be changed7
,”8
 in this word they wanted to
shame the king, lest the decree which had been marked out
by him, may not be certain9
 and the rest of the things which
were set out by him may be considered to be invalid.

26.1. And so why1
did the satraps accuse only Daniel? For
For always the three boys were also with him praying. For if
they did not obey the prescription of Nebuchadnezzar, much
more would they not obey the decree of Darius. 26.2. But this is
the reason. For since then in the times of Nebuchadnezzar
while Daniel was present, the Chaldeans accused no other
except the three boys alone, their testimony was not
forgotten2
. In this way now in the times of Darius they
accused only Daniel. For the call to martyrdom was his.
26.3. For a man does not forsake God on account of3
time, so that in time4
 he may be glorified. As the prophet
says, “He who made his worlds, he shall call each one of
them by name.”5
27.1. Then accordingly, Darius, not being able to further
contradict the satraps, said for Daniel to be brought and they
cast him into the den of lions. 27.2. And the king, answering
said to him, “Your God whom you serve perpetually, he
himself will rescue you6
” urging him to be of good cheer. “For
since, even though I wish to help, I am not able even though I
am king, but God whom you serve will rescue you7
,”8
 in order
order to show that what is impossible for men is possible
with God.9
27.3. “And they brought a stone and set at the mouth of
the den and the king sealed it with his signet ring,”10 that the
matter may not be changed regarding Daniel. 27.4. And this
was a malicious deed, for the satraps were cautious, lest

secretly the king command Daniel to be drawn out of the den
and so they thought fit to seal the stone. 27.5. In which manner
also the chiefs of the Pharisees did to the Savior having sealed
the stone with a guard.1
28.1. Accordingly after this happened, “The king departed
to his house and he went to bed without supper and food was
not brought to him and sleep left him.”2
28.2. How much did
did the righteous man do, who feared God, so that the king
was so grieved over him to not take sustenance! 28.3. And the
satraps made merry all night, thinking that they were taking a
prize from Daniel, but the king being sleepless all night
bewailed that such a man was unrighteously destroyed, and so
he was cautious lest on account of him he himself also be
endangered.
28.4. For the events which happened to Nebuchadnezzar
and what happened to Belshazzar did not escape his notice,
the former was banished from his kingdom, the latter on
account of drinking from the holy vessels was killed that same
night. 28.5. Accordingly, “Then he arose at first light3
 and
came to the den of lions in haste, and having called in a
strong voice said, ‘Daniel, slave of the living God, your God
whom you serve perpetually, was he able to take you out4
from the mouth of the lions?’”5
28.6. And so why, having been disturbed6
, did the king
cry this word, except that he had heard what happened to the
boys, who were not willing to obey the prescription of the
king, and were preserved from the furnace of fire?...7

same happened to him, but he feared God and despised1
 the
decree of the Medes and Persians.
29.1. “And Daniel said to the king, ‘My God sent his
angel and he shut the mouth of the lions and they did not
harm me because before him uprightness was found in me
and before you, O king, I have not committed
transgressions.’”2
29.2. What great trust he has3
 to God rather than to men!
For men despair and are handed over to death4
, but God
does not abandon his slaves. On account of this the Psalmist
teaches saying, “It is better to trust in the Lord than to trust
in man. It is better to hope in the Lord than to hope in
rulers.”5
29.3. Then accordingly when the angel appeared in the
den, the wild beasts were tamed and the lions, wagging their
tails at him, rejoiced as being subjected by a new6
 Adam.
They, licking the holy feet of Daniel, rolled around to taste the
soles of his feet and they longed to accompany him7
.
29.4. For if we believe that, after Paul was condemned to
beasts and that a lion was set upon him, it reclined at his feet
and licked him all around, how do we not also believe what
happened to Daniel, which even Darius himself described to
all, having dispatched it through scribes? And in the books of
the Persians and Medes it is read up to today that these things
really occurred, so that not only the Hebrews nor only the
Babylonians, but also the Medes and the Persians and all the
nations who live under heaven, having heard the things which
happened, they themselves feared God.

29.5. And then, as Darius heard the voice of Daniel, he
was amazed and marveled and commanded the stone to be
rolled away and he saw Daniel sitting in the midst of the lions
and he was stroking the hair of their heads with his own
hands. And then, having invited everyone, he exhibited to
them the marvelous spectacle, beasts which were tamed by a
man and who were comforted by his hands. 29.6.
Accordingly after taking Daniel up “from the den, no
destruction was found in him at all because he trusted in his
God.”1
30.1. Then, “the king spoke and they brought the men
who accused Daniel and they themselves and their sons and
their wives were cast into the den of lions, and they did not
reach the bottom of the den before the lions mastered them,
and they ground all their bones.”2
30.2. And so they who have trusted in a human king and
in wealth, they themselves dug a trench, and they fell in it for
their destruction. 30.3. And then this judgment happened to the
three boys, who though being in the furnace of fire were not
mastered, but the fire passed through to the outside and
consumed the Chaldeans, 30.4. For the eyes of God
righteously assigns worthy judgment to men. 30.5. As also
befell Haman, who wished to annihilate on one day Mordecai
and his race, and having readied fifty cubit gallows for
Mordecai3
, Haman4
 himself with all his household were
hanged on it. 30.6. Now they who accused Daniel and handed
him over as food for beasts, they themselves were destroyed
by lions.

31.1.Then Darius wrote to all peoples, tribes and tongues,
to those who dwell in all the earth, declaring peace to all and
then through what was published by his decree, compelled
them to worship God just as it says, “The decree which was
set from my face in every realm of my kingdom that all
should tremble and fear before the face of the God of Daniel
because he himself is the living God, who endures forever
and his kingdom shall not be destroyed and his dominion is
forever. He assists and rescues and works wonders and signs
in heaven and on the earth, who took Daniel from the
mouth1
 of the lions.”2
31.2. You see, today Babylon is the world, the satraps are
its authorities, Darius is their king, the den is Hades, the lions
are punishing angels. 31.3. And so imitate the blessed Daniel
who did not fear the satraps and do not obey a human
decree, so that after being cast into the den of lions you may
be guarded by the angel, and you may tame beasts, and you
may be worshipped by them as a slave of God and no
destruction may be found in you, but being alive you may be
brought up from the den and may be found as a sharer of the
resurrection and you may rule over your enemies and you
may always give thanks to the living God. 31.4. For to him be
glory and might unto the endless age of ages. Amen.

Book 4
Concerning the visions of the
prophet Daniel1
Daniel’s vision of the four beasts
1.1. “In the first year of Belshazzar king of the Chaldeans,
Daniel saw a dream and the visions of his head were while he
was upon his bed, and he wrote down the vision.”2
1.2. And so
as much as was revealed by the Spirit through visions to the
blessed prophet, these things also he ungrudgingly3
 described
to others, so that he might not only, while prophesying the
things which are to come, reveal them to himself, but also
that it may be demonstrated to those who wish with faith to
search the godly writings of the prophet.
1.3. In all events he says, “I, Daniel, was looking, and
behold, four winds of heaven were blowing upon the Great
Sea, and four great beasts arose from the sea differing from
one another. The first was a lioness and feathers were upon it
as an eagle. I was looking until its feathers were plucked and
it was lifted up from the earth and it stood upon human feet
and a heart of a man was given to it. And behold, a second
beast was like a bear and it stood on one side and three ribs
were in its mouth between its teeth and they were speaking in
this way to it, ‘Rise, eat much flesh.’ After this I was looking,
and behold, there was another beast like a leopard and four
wings4
 of a bird were upon it and four heads were on the beast,
and authority was given to it. After this I was looking, and
behold, a fourth beast fearful and terrible and exceedingly

strong. Its teeth were iron and its nails bronze, and it was
eating and grinding and the remainder it trampled with its
feet. And it itself was exceedingly different from all the beasts
which were before it, and there were ten horns on it. I was
observing its horns, and behold, another smaller horn rose up
in the midst of them and three horns which were before it
were rooted out from its face. And behold, eyes as eyes of
the man were on this horn and a mouth speaking great things.
I was looking until thrones were set and the Ancient of Days
sat and his clothes were white as snow and the hair of his head
was as pure wool. His throne was a flame of fire, its1
 wheels
blazing fire. A river of fire gushed2
 from before it. A
thousand thousands attended him and myriad myriads stood
before him. He set out judgment and the books were
opened. Then I was looking at3
 the voice of great words
which that horn spoke, until the beast was killed4
 and its body
was destroyed and given to the burning of fire. And the
dominion of the rest of the beasts ceased, and a length of life
was given to them for a time.”5
2.1. And so when the different beast was shown to the
blessed prophet Daniel and it was shown that it differed from
the others, it is necessary for us to consider that he does not
discuss6
 any
7
 of the beasts as mere animals, but in a model and
image he portrays the kingdoms which have arisen in this
world, just as he portrays the beasts destroying humanity.
2.2. For the Great Sea indicates the whole world, he says;
“The four winds of heaven,”8
 which signal the fourfold

creation. 2.3. And so when he says, “I saw four beasts rising
from the sea,”1
 he speaks concerning the kingdoms of this
world.
2.4. “The first was a lioness and feathers were upon it as an
eagle.”2
 And so he, while speaking, names a lioness as the
kingdom of the Babylonians which Nebuchadnezzar then
ruled. 2.5. Then he says, “feathers were upon it as an eagle,”3
because the king was lifted up and raised up against God,
being puffed up4
 in heart on account of the greatness and
glory which came to him.
2.6. Then he says, “Its feathers were plucked and it was
lifted up from the earth and it stood upon human feet and a
heart of a man was given to it.”5
2.7. For this really happened
to Nebuchadnezzar, just as has been indicated in the book
before this book, and he himself testifies in this way about that
which happened to him, as he was banished from his kingdom
and his glory was taken away and so was the majesty which he
procured at first. 2.8. And so just as he says to strip the
feathers of the whole bird, he is powerless and is easily
caught, and in this way at that time the powers of the king
were removed, through which he imagined to boast and to be
high-minded, but6
 then was afraid and fled into the desert, so
that he may not be killed by them.
2.9. When Scripture says, “It stood upon human feet and a
heart of a man was given to it,”7
 it is clear that
Nebuchadnezzar, having humbled himself and recognized
that he is a man lying under the authority of God, he, after
begging the Lord, obtained from him a good heart, and again
his kingdom and glory were reestablished. 2.10. Just as he

himself testifies saying, “And after the end of the days I,
Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven and my wits
returned to me and I blessed the Most High and praised and
glorified him that lives forever, because his authority is an
eternal authority and his kingdom is from generation to
generation and all who dwell upon the earth are reckoned as
nothing and they are as nothing.”1
3.1. While these things were then happening in this way to
Nebuchadnezzar in those times, just as the blessed Daniel
disclosed to us in the vision, the king himself likewise
confessed it, and after he died2
, the office came to Belshazzar.
When he himself, on account of the deed which he did at
night, was taken away, as has been indicated in the book
before this book, then Darius the Mede received the
kingdom, being sixty two years old. So suitably the prophet
describes another beast rising, which was the bear, so that in
this he may display the kingdom of the Persians.
3.2. He says, “Three ribs were in its mouth.”3
 He calls
three ribs the three regions of nations, which the same beast
ruled, which were Medes, Assyrians, and Babylonians. 3.3.
“And that they were speaking in this way to it, ‘Rise, eat much
flesh.’”4
 For then in those times the Persians rose up and laid
waste to all the land and made many of the men their slaves,
and they utterly destroyed everything. 3.4. For just as the beast,
the bear is a sordid and flesh-eating creature, tearing with
both its claws and teeth, in this way also the kingdom of the
Persians became, which presided for two hundred and thirty
years.
3.5. Some of the historians recorded that these ruled two
hundred forty-five years until Darius the chief, whom

Alexander of Macedon deposed in the seventh year and
transferred the kingdom of the Persians to the Greeks. Just
as also Daniel says, “After this I was looking, and behold,
another beast like a leopard and four wings1
 of a bird were
upon it and four heads were on the beast, and authority was
given to it.”2
3.6. And so having named a leopard, he signals the
kingdom of the Greeks, which Alexander of Macedon began,
and he compares them to a leopard on account of them being
sharp in mind and resourceful in reasoning and relentless in
heart, in which manner also the spotted creature is the model3
of the kingdom of the Greeks, quick to do evil and quick to drink
the blood of men. 3.7. He says, “Four wings of a bird were
upon it and four heads were on the beast.”4
 For after the
kingdom of Alexander was lifted up and grew in strength and
was named in all the world, his kingdom was divided to his
four chiefs.
3.8. For while dying, Alexander distributed it to his
companions who were of his race, four men, Seleucus,
Demetrius, Ptolemy, and Philip, and these all put on crowns5
,
just as Daniel predicts and was recorded in the first book of
the Maccabees.6
4.1. And so after the Greeks ruled for three
hundred years, the prophet signals to me again another
kingdom.
4.2. For he spoke in this way, “After this I was looking,
and behold, a fourth beast fearful and terrible and exceedingly
strong. Its teeth were iron and its nails bronze, and it was eating
and grinding and the remainder it trampled with its feet. And
it itself was exceedingly different from all the beasts which
were before it, and there were ten horns on it. I was observing

its horns, and behold, another smaller horn rose up in the
midst of them and three horns which were before it were
rooted out from its face. And behold, eyes as eyes of the
man were on this horn and a mouth speaking great things. I
was looking until thrones were set and the Ancient of Days
sat and his clothes were white as snow and the hair of his head
were as pure wool. His throne was a flame of fire, its1
 wheels
blazing fire. A river of fire gushed2s
 from before it. Thousand
thousands attended him and myriad myriads stood before
him. He set out judgment and the books were opened. Then
I was looking at3
 a voice of great words which that horn
spoke, until the beast was killed4
 and his body was destroyed
and given to the burning of fire. And the dominion of the
rest of the beasts ceased, and a length of life was given to
them for a time.”5
5.1. And so,6
 after the kingdom of the Greeks, a kingdom
arose none other than that which now rules which has also
been established and this is clear to all. 5.2. Which has iron
teeth on account of the fact that it overpowers all and grinds
with its own strength, just like iron, it tramples the remainder
with its feet. On account of which another kingdom is no
longer left7
 after this one, except its ten horns which grow up
from it and in the midst of them one small horn arises and it
roots out three of the first horns.
5.3. For just as the prophet foretold the leopard, that
“four heads were on the beast,”8
 it happened that also the
kingdom of Alexander was divided to the four chiefs, in this

way it is necessary to also expect now that ten horns shall
arise from this kingdom, whenever the time of the beast should
be fulfilled and the small horn, which is the Antichrist,
suddenly should show forth among them, and righteousness
should be taken from the earth and all the world will then be
near the consummation.
5.4. So that it is necessary for us to not misconceive1
 the
plan of God, but to be long-suffering and to beg that we may
not fall upon such times, nor indeed lack faith2
, as though these
these things are not destined to be. 5.5. For if the first things,
as much as the prophets foretold, did not happen, neither
should you expect these. But if those things happened
according to their own times just as was foretold, these things
also shall be always accomplished.
5.6. For when some say, “And when will these things be?”
This is a mark of unfaithful men who do not believe. But to
foreknow what will be and to believe that it will be in this
way, is a mark of a blessed man who sees3
 and is silent, so that
that he may not, when he is speaking many things, endanger
himself.4
6.1. But let us also demonstrate in another way that these
things are true and clear and happen to the slaves of God. 6.2.
For Scripture does not lie in any way, nor does the Holy
Spirit deceive his slaves the prophets, through whom he is
well pleased to announce the plan of God to men, so that
seeing these things happen, we might not fall, nor be troubled
as beholding these strange things. 6.3. For otherwise the
consummation is not able to come upon this world except in
this way.

6.4. For just as upon Sodom when their transgressions
were fulfilled, immediately fire descended upon them and
they were destroyed, in this way it will be even now, when
lawlessness multiplies in the world and the present iron beast
is divided into ten horns and anarchy occurs and discord,
while others from here and there rend the kingdom, then the
end shall come upon them.
7.1. And so since we, having also reached this point in
another book and explained an account concerning these
things, both the advent of the Antichrist and his race, and
from where and how the deceiver shall appear, and we were
not silent about his works, nevertheless also now I will
mention this only a little, so that a man may steadfastly stand
against all things, not ever1
 stammering in mind, and be able to
believe in God from a whole heart.
7.2. For the blessed Daniel, explaining the previous vision
to Nebuchadnezzar, says, “I now speak concerning the dream
of the image, which shows forth to be a golden head, then
hands and arms and a silver chest, next a bronze stomach and
thighs, then iron legs, next feet, in them part are iron and part
are clay,”2
 so that in this it may be shown what he described is
now described again in this3
 vision.
7.3. As the gold is the kingdom of the Babylonians, which
was the lioness, the silver that of the Persians, which was the
bear, next the bronze that of the Greeks, which Alexander of
Macedon began4
, so that it may be shown as the leopard.
7.4. After these things he says, “iron legs”, so that he may
signal the fearful and terrible beast, which has iron teeth,
which are the Romans who rule now, who are strong as iron.
7.5. In all events after the iron legs of the image, what

remains, except the feet in which are ten toes and these being
mixed with clay and iron, so that through the ten toes the ten
horns may be signaled, and through the clay and iron, their
discord may be signaled, when they shall be commingled in the
seed of men, but they shall not be united with one another.1
7.6. For just as iron is not mixed with clay, in this way at that
time men will not be able to agree with one another, but
others from here and there shall carry disorder2
 and divide the
royal kingdom to themselves according to their nation.
8.1. But since the grace of God richly teaches those who
hope on him and who despise this world, we shall not pass
over this. In a word, the blessed prophet named all kingdoms
which were before, having likened them to beasts, but he did
not declare the kingdom which now is instituted, as in what
sort of animal3
 it was. 8.2. I will speak more clearly
concerning it, so that one may better consider what has been
stated. For after he was saying that the kingdom of the
Babylonians was a lion and that of the Persians a bear and
that of the Greeks a leopard, why does he not say that the
kingdom of the Romans was an animal4
, but he says it was
“fearful and exceedingly terrible, its teeth were iron and its
claws bronze,”?5
8.3. Consider, O man, and glorify the Lord. 8.4. For when
the Babylonians ruled as one nation6
, they themselves then in
those times resolved to rule all nations, he righteously names
them as a lioness, as a creature of one form7
. 8.5. Similarly
also the Persians are one sordid nation, which only spoke

with the one tongue1
. On account of this he likened them
also to a bear. 8.6. Likewise also the Greeks he said were a
leopard. For all the Greeks were ruling all the world.
8.7. But now the powerful beast is not one nation, but it is
of many tongues and it gathers to itself from many races of
men and prepares an army in a line of battle, and all are called
Romans, though all are not from one country. 8.8. So that the
prophet was rightly amazed and foreseeing what was to come,
he did not name from what country the beast was from, but he
was amazed, saying, “My spirit shuddered in my being, I
Daniel, and the visions of my head confused me. And one of
those who stood came forth and sought precisely from him
concerning all these things. And he said to me the certainty
and made known to me the interpretation of the words.”2
8.9.
And so, who are those who stand but the angels who stand
before the face of the glory of the Lord and furnish a
constant ministry to him, always attending to what has been
commanded by him?
9.1. But since a certain thought gnaws at the heart,3
 we
shall not abandon the indescribable itself, which is able to aid
a soul. 9.2. For when in the forty-second year of Caesar
Augustus the Lord was born, when the kingdom of the
Romans flourished, the Lord, through the apostles,
summoned all nations and all tongues and made a nation of
Christians who believe in the Lord and who carry a new name
in heart, in the same manner this kingdom now4
 is
counterfeited5
by that which rules according to the operation
of Satan, but similarly this kingdom also collects those born

from all nations and prepares those who are called Romans
for war.1
9.3. And on account of this also the first census happened
under Augustus, when the Lord was born in Bethlehem, so
that the men of this world, being registered in the earthly
kingdom, were called Romans, but those who believe in the
heavenly kingdom were named Christians, who on their
forehead carry the trophy2
 against death to the front line.
10.1. So that we may not turn aside from what is set
before, so that what was seen by the prophet may be shown as
true and so that what was perceived by us in the grace of the
Lord and what was spoken may be sure, let us see if the angel
confirms our words, who teaches the blessed Daniel, for he
speaks in this way, “These four beasts are four kingdoms
which shall arise upon the earth, and which shall be removed,
and the saints of the most high shall inherit3
 the kingdom and
possess it forever and ever.”4
10.2. And so it is necessary for the three beasts to have
already passed away and to have ceased, just as was shown
above, and while one beast is yet beginning to culminate5
, if
this also is removed, the remaining6
 earthly things cease, but
the heavenly things begin, so that the perpetual and eternal
kingdom of the saints may be shown and the heavenly
kingdom may be clearly displayed to all, neither through a
form as seen on the mountain of Sinai, nor in a pillar of cloud
as revealed on the mountain peak, but with powers and
armies of angels, incarnate God and man7

of Man, the judge who is coming from the heavens into the
world.
10.3. Who shall remove all kingdoms which are in this
world and shall thresh and shall winnow and shall scatter
them as chaff from the summer threshing floor. And shall
give the kingdom to the saints of the Most High as he collects
grain for his barn, but the chaff heap he burns with
unquenchable fire, though now he is despised by the godless
and impious, and blasphemed by the unbelievers, who do not
consider what is written, nor consider the authority of
judgment laid1
 upon them.2
10.4. For though he now also
delays for a time, not wishing to bear judgment to the world,
and so fulfills the prescription of his Father, but when he comes
he will come with his armies and render to each according to
his works.
11.1. And so as many of you all who reverently draw near
to God, observe the person3
 who long ago was shown to the
people by Moses and was manifested on the mountain and
was proclaimed by the prophets and was seen as a man by the
blessed Daniel, concerning whom he says, “I was looking into
the vision of the night, and behold, one was coming like a son
of man with the clouds of heaven, and he reached the
Ancient of Days and was brought near to him and to him was
given power and honor and the kingdom and all peoples,
tribes, and tongues served him. His authority is an eternal
authority, which shall not pass away and his kingdom shall
not be destroyed.”4
11.2. And so he does not speak of another Ancient of
Days, but indeed the Lord and God and Master of all, the
Father of even Christ himself, who is the Ancient of Days5

he who does not grow old under time or days, concerning
whom was spoken above, “Thrones were set and the Ancient
of Days sat and his clothes were white as snow and the hair of
his head was as pure wool. His throne was a flame of fire, its1
wheels blazing fire. A river of fire gushed2
 from before it. A
thousand thousands attended him and myriad myriads stood
before him.”3
11.3. The Son of Man was brought to him, being borne by
a cloud and being carried by archangels, so that he may
receive from him every rule and authority and power and
kingdom, so that all peoples, tribes, and tongues may serve
him. 11.4. And so that one may not understand that his
kingdom, which was given to him by the Father, was
temporary or earthly, the prophet says, “His authority is an
eternal authority, which shall not pass away and his kingdom
shall not be destroyed.”4
11.5. And so the Father, having subjected all things to his
own Son, the things in the heavens and the things of the earth
and the things under the earth, through all of them he exhibited
him as being firstborn in all things, firstborn from God so that
the Son of God, being second after the Father5
, may be
displayed, firstborn before angels, so that also he may be
shown as Lord of angels, firstborn from a virgin, so that he
may be shown as reforming first-formed Adam in himself,
firstborn also from the dead so that he himself may be the
first fruits of our resurrection.
12.1. And so since all the prophets and apostles testify to
this, but because the lawless disobey him and blaspheme and
set at nothing what has been spoken and persecute and
oppress his slaves, and because they do not expect these things

which will be, let us ourselves see1
what will be, we who believe
in the Word of truth and who are led by his Word to eternal
life, who are taught by the prophets and who by the Spirit are
illuminated, so that we, becoming wise through his grace, may
observe the ancient things which were proclaimed and in due
time happened and will happen. Holding before our eyes the
judgment of God, we guard ourselves from all evil so that we
may flee from the eternal fire and incessant punishment.
12.2. For if even now these things do not come upon us
because the times are not yet fulfilled, it is still necessary to
pray that we not be found in such times in which these things
shall happen, lest one, having become weak from the great
persecution which comes to the world, should fall from
eternal life.
12.3. For it is needful to observe what the prophet says,
“And I precisely sought concerning the fourth beast, because
he was different than every other beast, and was exceedingly
fearful. His iron teeth and his bronze claws were eating and
grinding and he tramples the remainder with his feet and
concerning his ten horns which were on his head and concerning
the other which arose and rooted out three former2
horns, the
eyes and the mouth of whom were speaking great things and
his appearance was greater than the rest. I was watching and
that horn made war with the saints and prevailed upon them,
until the Ancient of Days came and gave judgment to the
saints of the Most High, and the season arrived and the saints
possessed the kingdom.”3
12.4. And so we already arrived at this point and said that it is
clear that this is the fourth kingdom, from which no other
greater kingdom or even such a kingdom like it has arisen on
the earth, from which ten horns are about to spring forth.

For it will be divided into ten kingdoms1
 and in them another
small horn shall arise, which is that of the Antichrist and he
shall root out three who were before him, that is he shall
destroy the three kings of Egypt and of the Libyans and of the
Ethiopians, wishing to possess for himself every kingdom.
12.5. Who having mastered the remaining seven horns, he
rules the remainder, having in himself been endowed under
an unnatural2
 and evil spirit to rouse war against the saints and
to persecute all of them everywhere, wishing to be glorified and
to be worshipped as God by all. 12.6. Just as also Ezekiel says
concerning him, “Against whom your heart was lifted up and
you have said ‘I am God’”3
 and again “Will you,4
 while
speaking to those whom are killing you, say ‘I am a God’?
You are a man and not God.”5
12.7. And Isaiah says similarly,
“But you say in your mind, ‘I will ascend to heaven, I will set
my throne upon the clouds of heaven, I will encamp on the
holy mountain, I will be like the Most High.’”6

13.1. And so if one wishes to meticulously discuss
concerning him, these things are more clearly exhibited in
another book, so that we may not be about to compose an
account concerning him a second time. 13.2. But now let us
speak of what lies ahead concerning the beast which now is
instituted7
.
13.3. For Daniel speaks in this way, “And the angel told
me that the fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon the
earth which prevails over all the kingdoms and devours all the
earth and tramples it and breaks it into pieces. And his ten
horns shall arise as ten kings and after them another shall

arise who shall surpass all others who were before in
wickedness and shall speak words against the Most High and
shall deceive the saints of the Most High and shall suppose to
change times and law and it shall be given in his hand for a
time and times and half a time. And judgment sat and they
shall remove the dominion to abolish it and to destroy
completely1
, and the kingdom and the authority and the
greatness of the kings, which are under all of heaven, was
given to the saints of the Most High, and his kingdom is an
eternal kingdom and all chiefs shall slave to him and obey him.
This is the end of the account.”2
14.1. And so when the prophet, wishing to persuade us
according to all things and to examine the truth of what was
seen by him, he inquired from one of the angels who stood
near, that he himself also may be more precisely taught
concerning the fourth beast, for he says, “I sought more
precisely concerning it because he was fearful and terrible.”3

And so the angel teaching him, but rather persuading us also
through him to believe in what was rightly seen by him, he
described to him all which was about to happen in the end,
both the division of the fourth beast into the ten horns which
arose from it, and the manifestation of the Antichrist in them
and his war against the saints and his time, which is about to
commence
4
.
14.2. For he says, “It was given into his hand for time and
times and half a time,”5
 which signals three-and-a-half years,
and after these things the coming judgment6
, for he says,
“thrones were set and the judgment sat and the kingdom was

given to the saints of the Most High, but the body of the
beast was given to the burning of fire.”1
14.3. For, “the time approached,”2
 that is, all at once the
time was fulfilled and the saints possessed the kingdom, when
the Judge of judges and the King of kings in the future comes
from heaven, who shall remove every chief and power which
opposes him and shall consume all in an eternal fire,
punishing the unrighteous, but he shall give to his slaves both
prophets and martyrs and to all who fear him the eternal
kingdom. 14.4. As the prophet says, “This is the end of the
account. I, Daniel, my thoughts greatly troubling me, and my
form was changed and I kept the matter in my heart.”
3
15.1. And so it is necessary for every man who reads the
godly writings to imitate the prophet Daniel and not to be
rash and heedless, seeking a time before the due time and
desiring to see the fruit of the fig, but to hold with fear the
mystery of God in his heart, so that he himself may not,
having ensnared himself4
 with his own lips, his own soul
become liable.5
15.2. For the time shall come when the almond shall
blossom and the caper-berry shall grow rough and the
grasshopper shall multiply, the fig shall sprout and the fruit of
apostasy shall prosper. Then the door of life shall be shut
and the water pots from the spring shall be shattered and the
wheel shall run afoul in the pit and the crowd shall be idle
because they mourn and all shall arise at the sound of a
sparrow and all the daughters of song shall be troubled and
the mourners shall be gathered in the market and man shall
depart to his eternal home.6

16.1. But one will say, “And when will these things be? In
what season or time is the deceiver about to be revealed?
And what shall be the day of the appearing of the Lord?” 16.2.
The disciples also similarly sought to learn these things from
the Lord, but he concealed the day from them, so that he may
render them all as watchful for what is to come, always
meditating and expecting each day the heavenly cloud, lest
men, ever on account of the long time, neglecting what was
prescribed by him, and growing sluggish while he tarries, fall
from the life of heaven.1
16.3. For he says, “Be watchful for you do not know what
day or what hour your Lord comes, either evening, or
midnight, or morning.”2
16.4. On account of this he says,
“Blessed is that slave, whom when his Lord comes, he finds
him awake. Truly I say to you that he will appoint him over
all his possessions. But if the wicked slave says in his heart,
‘My Lord tarries to come,’ and he begins to beat his serving
boys and serving girls, and to eat and to drink with drunkards,
his Lord will come in a day which he does not expect and in
an hour which he does not know and cut him in two and set
his portion with the unbelievers. For there will be weeping
and gnashing of teeth.”3
 “On account of this I say to you: be
watchful.”4
16.5. And so our Lord himself in the Gospel,
teaching these things, displays them to the disciples.
16.6. Similarly, also after his resurrection, the disciples
broached these same things, “Asking him saying, ‘Lord, will
you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?’ But he said to
them, ‘It is not for you to know the times or seasons which
the Father has set in his own authority, but you shall receive
power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you and you will be

for me martyrs1
 in both Jerusalem and in Galilee and all the
land of Samaria and unto the ends of the earth.’”2
17.1. And so since he hid the day from them, but through
the signs which have happened, through which a man3
 will
easily discover the time of the end, he declares that we ought to
know the events according to their time, and when we see them,
to be silent. 17.2. But it is necessary for these things to be even
if we do not want them happen. For the truth never lies.
17.3. For just as he said concerning the city of Jerusalem,
“When you see Jerusalem encircled by armies, then you know
that her desolation draws near,”4
 and what was spoken about
her has come, in this way it is needful to also now expect the
rest to follow.
17.4. He says, “For whenever you see the abomination of
desolation standing in the holy place, let the reader
understand, then let those in Judea flee to the mountains, and
he who is on the rooftop not descend to take anything from
his house, and he who is in the field not return back to take
his clothes. Woe to those who are pregnant5
 and nursing in
those days. For then there will be a great tribulation such
which has not been from the beginning of the world nor shall
ever be. And unless those days were shortened not any flesh
would be saved.”6
17.5. And so in this he made it clear to us,
so that we may never doubt anything.
17.6. And again he says, “Whenever you see the
abomination of desolation standing in the holy place,” and,
“whenever you see a fig sprouting its leaves know that the
harvest is near. In this way also whenever you see all these

things happen, know that it is near the doors.”1
17.7. And so
while the abomination has not yet appeared, but while only
the fourth beast still reigns, how is the manifestation of the
Lord able to be?
17.8. But one will say, “It is written, ‘Whenever you see
wars and anarchy, then you will know that it is near.’”2
 Yes it
is written, he says, “Nation will be roused against nation and
kingdom against kingdom and there will be earthquakes and
hunger and plague in many places,”3
 which already has
happened and will happen. 17.9. “But all these things are the
beginning of birth pangs,” 4 he says, “But the end is not yet in
in them,”5
 for first it is necessary for the Gospel of the Lord
to be preached in the whole world for a witness to all nations
and in this way the end shall come, when all at once the time
is fulfilled.
18.1. For I will describe also what happened not a long
time ago in Syria. 18.2. For there was one who governed6
 the
church there and he, having not laboriously read the godly
Scriptures, nor having followed the voice of the Lord, was
deceived and he himself also deceived others.
18.3. For while the Lord said, “There shall arise many
false Christs and false prophets and they shall give signs and
wonders in order to deceive if possible even the elect.7
 Then
if someone says to you, ‘Behold Christ is here or there.’ 8 Do
Do not believe. ‘Behold, he is in the desert,’ do not go out,
‘Behold, he is in the storehouses,’ do not go in.”9

having not considered these things persuaded many of the
brothers, with their wives and children, to go out into the
desert in order to meet with Christ, and who were even led
astray in the mountains and onto roads, wandering aimlessly.
So that after a little while it was necessary for them that they
all be apprehended as robbers by the commander in order to
be killed, except that his wife happened to be a believer, and
he was appealed to by her and put in order that matter so that
a persecution did not come upon all Christians through them.
18.4. How great their foolishness and stupidity, so that
they entered into the desert and sought Christ, in which
manner also in the times of Elisha the prophet the sons of the
prophets sought Elijah for three days in the mountains,
though he was assumed into heaven.1
18.5. And so while the
Lord says, “Just as lightning comes out from the east and
flashes unto the west, in this way will be the advent of the
Son of Man,”2
 plainly and clearly signaling in this that he
himself is destined to arrive with the power and glory of his
Father from heaven, but they sought him in the mountains
and in the desert.
18.6. For in this way his second advent will not be like his
first. Before, as a simple man only he appeared, but now as a
judge of all the world he arrives. And then, he arrived to save
man
3
, but now he arrives to punish all who trespass and who
commit sacrilege against him. 18.7. But we say these things to
support4
 the faithful brothers, so that they may not have a
misconception of the plan of God, knowing that for each
one, on whichever day he departs from this world, he has

been already judged.1
 For the consummation has come upon
him.
19.1. But a certain other man was similarly in Pontus, and
he himself governed2
 the church, being a reverent and
humble man, though not applying himself unfailingly to the
Scriptures but rather believing dreams which he saw. 19.2. For
when a first and second and a third dream happened to him,
he began to foretell the future to the brothers as a prophet,
“This I saw and this is about to be.” 19.3. And once, having
been led astray he said, “Brothers, know that after one year
the judgment is about to be.”
19.4. They who heard him who predicted, “The day of the
Lord is imminent,” with weeping and lamenting they begged
the Lord night and day holding before their eyes the
approaching day of judgment 19.5. And he led the brothers to
such fear and terror so to allow their lands and fields to be
desolate, and the wealthy to destroy their possessions. 19.6.
But he said to them, “If it does not happen just as I said, do
not believe the Scriptures anymore but do whatever each of
you wishes.”
19.7. But they waited for the result and after a year
nothing was fulfilled of what that man said happened, and he
himself was shamed as a deceiver, but the Scriptures were
shown as true, but the brothers were found scandalized3
 so
that henceforth their virgins were married and their men dwelt
in fields. They, who sold their possessions without plan, were
found later begging.
20.1. These things happen to ignorant and simple men, as
many as do not attend precisely to the Scriptures, but more

pleasurably obey human traditions and their illusions and
their dreams and mythologies and gnawing words. 20.2. For
also the same happened to the sons of Israel, who setting at
naught, they added to the law of God, and being well pleased
they were obedient to the traditions of the elders.
20.3. And now some undertake1
 the same things, clinging
to vain visions and to the teachings of demons and often
determining a fast both on the Sabbath and the Lord's day,
which Christ did not determine, so that they dishonor the
Gospel of Christ. 21.1. And so since the words of the Lord
are true, but every man is a liar, just as it is written, let us see
if the apostle Paul also is in agreement with the words of the
Lord.
21.2. For writing to the Thessalonians and advising them
to always watch and to persist in prayers, but not yet to
expect the day of judgment, because the time is not yet
fulfilled, he spoke in this way to them, “We ask you brothers,
concerning the advent of the Lord, that you not be afraid
through a word or through a letter as from us, as that the day
of the Lord has come, let no one deceive you in any way,
because it will not come unless first the apostasy comes and the
man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes and
is exalted over everything which is called godly or pious, so
that he sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is
God. Do you not remember, when I was still with you I
taught you these things? And now know what restrains him so
that he may be revealed in his own time. For the mystery of
lawlessness already is at work, only he who restrains until now
is taken2
 from the midst. And then the lawless one shall be
revealed whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the spirit of his
mouth and will abolish him with the manifestation of his
advent, whose advent is according to the work of Satan.”3

21.3. And so who is “He who restrains until now,”1
except the fourth beast, which, when it is set aside and is
taken from the midst, the deceiver shall come? 21.4. But
always you seek the troublesome, which is how many years
remain for the beast, so that he may depart, not
understanding that seeking these things, you seek danger for
yourself and you desire to see a hastier judgment. 21.5. For
Scripture says, “Woe to those who desire the day of the Lord!
This is darkness and not light. In which manner one flees
from the face of a lion but2
 he encounters a bear, and he who
bursts into his house and he leans his hand upon the wall and
a snake bites him. Will not this day of the Lord be darkness
and not light? Even gloom which has no daylight.”3
22.1. But why do you waste labor over times and seek the
day of the Lord, when the Savior concealed it from us? Tell
me, if you know the date of your departure, why do4
 you
interfere with the consummation of all the world?5
22.2. For
if God were not long-suffering over us on account of his
exceeding good heartedness, why did he pass over all our sins
of old.
22.3. Read what was spoken also by John in the
Apocalypse, “And I saw the souls of those who were
beheaded for the sake of the name of Jesus under the altar
and they shouted to God and said, ‘For how long, O Lord
our God, will you not judge and avenge our blood upon
those who dwell upon the earth?’ And to them was given
white robes and it was said to them that they would endure
for a little time, until also their fellow slaves may fulfill their
martyrdom, who are destined to be killed as they also.”6

22.4. And so if it is assigned to persevere with martyrs,
who pour out their own blood on behalf of Christ, why do
you not also persevere so that also others may be saved and
the number of the chosen, even of the saints, may be fulfilled?
23.1. So that in this we may not waste the indemonstrable
matter which lies before us for the sake of being an inquisitive
man, we, being compelled to speak what we are not able1
,
speak by force.2
23.2. For when the times from the
foundation of the world and from Adam are reckoned, they
furnish this matter quite clearly to us who seek an answer.
23.3. For the first advent of our Lord in the flesh, when
he was born in Bethlehem, was December 25th
,

 Wednesday,4
while Augustus was in his forty-second year, but from Adam,
five thousand and five hundred years. He suffered in the
thirty-third year, March 25th
,

Tiberius Caesar, while Rufus and Roubellion were Consuls.7
23.4. And so it is absolutely necessary for six-thousand
years to be fulfilled, so that the Sabbath rest may come, the
holy day, in which God rested from all his works which he
began to do. 23.5. The Sabbath is a model and an image of
the coming kingdom of the saints, when the saints shall coreign with Christ, when he arrives from heaven, as also John
in his Apocalypse describes. For a day of the Lord is as a
thousand years. 23.6. And so since in six days God made all
things, it is necessary for six thousand years to be fulfilled. For

they are not yet fulfilled, as John says, “Five have fallen, but
one is,” such is the sixth millennium, “the other has not yet
come,”1
 saying “the other” he describes the seventh millennium
in which there shall be rest.
24.1. But one will always say, “How will you demonstrate
to me whether2
 the Savior was born in the five thousandth
and five hundredth year?3
24.2. Be easily instructed, O man.
For in the desert long ago under Moses there were models
and images of spiritual mysteries which concerned the
tabernacle and they fulfilled this number, so that having come
to the utmost of truth in Christ4
 you are able to apprehend
these things which are fulfilled.
24.3. For he says to him, “And you shall make an ark of
incorruptible wood and you will gild it with pure gold inside
and outside and you shall make its height two cubits and a
half and its breadth a cubit and a half and its height a cubit
and a half.”5
 The measure of which added together makes
five and a half cubits, so that the five thousand five hundred
years may be demonstrated, in which time the Savior comes
from the Virgin, and then he offered6
 the Ark, his own body,
into the world, gilded in pure gold, inside with the Word,
outside with the Holy Spirit, so that the truth may be shown
and the Ark may be manifested7
.
24.4. And so from the generation8
 of Christ it is necessary
necessary to count the remaining five hundred years to the

consummation of the six thousand years, and in this way the
end will be. 24.5. But because in the fifth and a half time the
Savior arrived in the world bearing the incorruptible ark, that
is his own body, John says,1
 “and it was the sixth hour,”2
 so
that half of the day may be demonstrated, a day of the Lord is
like thousand years. And so the half of these is five hundred
years.
24.6. For he3
 does not admit him to be soon at hand. For
For the law was still burdensome, nor again had the sixth day
been fulfilled. For he celebrated the washing,4

 the fifthand-a-half day, so in that remaining half time the Gospel may
be preached to all the world and when the sixth day is
fulfilled, the present life may cease. 24.7. For since the
Persians ruled and reigned two hundred thirty years, and after
them the Greeks, so as being more honorable, three hundred
years, it is absolutely necessary that the fourth beast be
stronger and greater than all of those before it and to therefore
reign five hundred years, when the times are consummated
and the ten horns arise from it at the end, the Antichrist will
show forth in them, concerning whom we have made a
previous6
 account.
24.8. Then while he makes war and persecutes the saints,
then it is necessary to expect from heaven the manifestation
of the Lord so that the King of kings may be displayed visibly
to all and the Judge of judges, coming with boldness and
glory, may be indicated. 24.9. Forasmuch as has already been
predestined by God as occurring and proclaimed by the

prophets, these in the same way will be fulfilled in their own
time.
Daniel’s vision of the goat and the ram
25.1. And so the prophet, after ceasing from what lies
before, teaches us the certainty of what will be with all
precision, he passes again to the kingdom of the Persians and
Greeks, describing another vision to us which happened and
was fulfilled in his own times, in order that in this he may
furnish us faithful and that he may be able to inspire us to be
more faithful to God for what is destined to come.
25.2. For he speaks in this way, “In the third year of
Belshazzar the king, a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after
that which appeared to me at first. And I was in Susa, in the
palace, which is in the land of Elam, and I was upon the
Ubal1
. And I lifted my eyes and I saw, and behold, one ram
standing upon the Ubal, and on him were high horns and one
was higher than the other and the high one arose last. And I
saw the ram butting to the sea and to the north and to the
south. And all the beasts did not stand before him and there
was not one who took out of his hand. And he did according
to his will and became great. And I myself was considering,
and behold, a male goat began from the west2
and came upon
the face of all the earth, and the male goat had a horn between
his eyes and he came on to the ram, which had horns which I
saw standing before the Ubal and he ran at him in the rush of
his strength. And I saw him reaching unto the ram and he
savaged him and smote the ram and he shattered both his
horns and there was not strength in the ram to stand before
him. And he hurled him to the earth and trampled him and
there was not one who took the ram out of his hand. And
the male goat grew exceedingly great, and when he was strong

his great horn was shattered, and four horns arose under him
to the four winds of heaven. And from one of them came
out one strong horn and he grew extraordinarily great to the
south and to the power of heaven. And he grew great unto the
power of heaven and some of the power and some of the stars
fell upon the earth and he trampled them. And until the
commander-in-chief shall deliver the captivity, on account of
him sacrifice was disordered and it happened also that it
prospered to him, and the Holy Place shall be desolated. And
sin was given as a sacrifice and righteousness was hurled to
the ground and he did it and he prospered. And I heard one
of the holy ones speaking and one of the holy ones said to a
holy one1
 who said, ‘Until when shall the vision stand and the
sacrifice be removed2
 and the sin of desolation, which was
given, and the Holy Place and power be trampled?’ And he
said to him ‘Until evenings and mornings, one thousand and
three hundred days and the holy place shall be finished3
.

’”
26.1. And so as much as he described in the first vision he
again recounts in detail these things a second time for the
building up of the faithful. 26.2. For “the ram butting to the
sea and to the north and to the south,”5
 he says is Darius the
king of the Persians, who prevailed over all nations. For he
says, “all the beasts did not stand before him.”6
26.3. But the
male goat who comes from the south7
, he says is Alexander
the Macedonian king of the Greeks.
26.4. And so when the goat comes to the ram and savages
him and beats him on his face and shatters and hurls him to
the earth and tramples him, it signals this, which also

happened. For Alexander having engaged war with Darius,
overpowered him and prevailed over all his power destroying
and trampling his camp.
26.5. Next after the male goat was exalted, “his great horn
was shattered, and four horns arose under him to the four
winds of heaven.”1
26.6. For after Alexander ruled all the land
of Persia and subjected them, later he died, dividing his
kingdom to his four Chiefs as is shown above, that is to
Seleucus, to Demetrius, to Ptolemy, and to Philip, from
whom one horn was exalted and grew great unto the power
of heaven.”
26.7. He says, “And on account of him the sacrifice was
disturbed,”2
 and “righteousness was hurled to the ground.”3

For Antiochus, who was called Epiphanes, being from the
race of Alexander, was king. And having reigned over Syria
and seizing all Egypt under himself, later he came to
Jerusalem and he entered into the Most Holy Place and took
all the treasures which were in the house of the Lord and the
golden lampstand and the table and the altar and he
committed great murder in the land and he spoke
immoderate words and prevented sacrifice and offering, and
he built a sacred grove and built idols in the city, and
sacrificed a pig, even a common animal, so that what was
spoken by the prophet may be fulfilled, “And on account of
him the sacrifice was disturbed and righteousness was hurled
to the ground and the Most Holy Place and the power was
trampled until evening and morning one thousand and three
hundred days.”4
26.8. For it occurred in that time three and half years the
most Holy Place continued desolate, and the one thousand
three hundred days were fulfilled up to the uprising of Judas

Maccabee after the death of Mathias his father and he
withstood Antiochus1
 and routed the army of Antiochus and
freed the city and recovered the holy vessels and renewed the
temple doing everything according to the law.
27.1. That these things are true, just as has been said,
Daniel himself testifies. 27.2. For he spoke in this way, “And
it happened when I saw the vision and I sought to
understand, and behold, there stood before me an appearance
of a man, and I heard the voice of a man above the midst of
the Ubal, and he called and he said, ‘Gabriel cause him to
understand that vision.’ And he came and stood holding me2
,
and when he came, I was astounded and fell upon my face
and he said to me, ‘Understand son of man. For the vision is
for the end of time.’ And while he spoke with me I was
astounded and I fell upon my face upon the ground and he
touched me and stood me on my feet and he said, ‘Behold, I
myself make known to you what will be at the end of wrath.
For the vision is of the end of time. The ram which you saw,
who had horns, he is the king of the Persians and Medes.
And the male goat is king of the Greeks. And the great horn
which was above the midst of his eyes, he is the first king.
And after he is shattered, four horns stood up after him, four
kings from his nation shall arise and not in his strength. And
at the end of their kingdom, when their sins are full, a king,
shameless in countenance, shall arise, and who understands
riddles. And his rule shall be strong and not in his own
strength and he shall destroy wonderful things and he shall
prosper and he shall practice and he shall destroy the mighty
and the holy people, and the yoke of his chain shall prosper.
Cunning is in his hand and in his heart he shall be magnified
and in cunning he shall destroy many and he shall stand for
the destruction of many and he shall shatter people as eggs in a

hand. And the vision of evening and morning which was said
is true. And you, seal the vision because it is in many days.’
And I Daniel fell asleep and was weak and I arose and did the
works of the king and I wondered at the vision and there was
no one who could understand it.”1
Daniel’s vision of the 70 weeks
28.1. And so since even the angel Gabriel, just as it2
 is
understood by us, described these things in this way to the
prophet, these things also happened and all these things are plainly
recorded in the Maccabees,3
 let us also see what he says in the
vision of the weeks. 28.2. For in this way, after reading the book
of Jeremiah the prophet, in which it is written that the Most
Holy Place is to be desolate seventy years,4
 in fasts and
petitions, he made confessions and asked that the people
would quickly return from captivity to the city of Jerusalem.
28.3. And so in this way he describes this and says, “In the
first year of Darius son of Ahasuerus,5
 of the seed of the
Medes, who reigned over the kingdom of the Chaldeans, I,
Daniel, understood in the books the number of years for the
completion of the desolation of Jerusalem, that is seventy
years, as the word of the Lord came upon Jeremiah the
prophet. And I gave my face to the Lord my God, to seek in
prayer and supplications, with fastings and in sackcloth. And
I prayed to the Lord my God and I confessed and I said,
‘Lord, great and wonderful God who keeps your covenant
and has mercy to those who love you and to those who keep
your commandments, we have sinned, we did wrong, we
were lawless, and we departed, and turned from your
commandments and from your laws and we did not obey

your slaves, the prophets, who spoke in your name to our
kings and our chiefs and our fathers and all the people of the
land. To you Lord be righteousness and unto us be shame of
face as on this day to the men of Judah and to those who
dwell in Jerusalem.’”1
29.1. And so confessing from the face of the people, he
describes these things, declaring the sins of the people and of
their fathers, who did not obey his slaves the prophets, who
were sent to them to speak in the name of the Lord. 29.2.
And when he was proclaiming every supplication in humility
and fastings and sackcloth, the angel Gabriel was sent forth
to him, in order to cause him to understand what was sought
by him.
29.3. For Daniel speaks in this way, “And while I was still
speaking and praying and declaring my sins and the sins of
my people, prostrating my pitiful case before the Lord my
God concerning the holy Mountain, and while I was still
speaking in prayer, behold, the man Gabriel, whom I saw in
the vision in the beginning, came flying and he touched me
around the evening sacrifice and he caused me to understand
and spoke with me and said, ‘Daniel, now I have come to
teach you understanding. In the beginning of your
supplication the word went out and I myself came to
proclaim to you that you are cherished man.’”2
30.1. See how the prophet likened the swiftness of angels
to winged flight, on account of the nimbleness and the
lightness of the weight of the angels, who are spirits flying
quickly to obey what is commanded as Solomon says, “Do

1

www.chronicon.net
149
not curse your king in an oath lest1
a winged bird carries your
words to him.”2
30.2. And so the angel Gabriel speaks to him in this way,
“From the day you gave your face to be humbled before the
Lord your God your supplication was heard and I myself was
sent to cause you to understand3
 so that you may not inquire
further before the time of time happens, for you are a greatly
cherished man. For you desire to see these things, which are
about to be ministered through me, but they will be fulfilled
in their own time. 4
30.3. And he added saying, “Seventy weeks have been cut
out for your people and for the holy city, for sin to be ended
and for sin to be sealed and for unrighteousness to be erased
and for lawlessness to be atoned and to bring in everlasting
righteousness and to seal dreams and prophecy5
 and to anoint
a Holy of Holies. And to know and understand from the
procession of the words for an answer to build Jerusalem
until Christ the ruler, seven weeks and sixty-two weeks.”6
30.4. And so having named seventy weeks he divided
them into two, so that what was spoken by him to the
prophet may be understood all the more. 30.5. For he says
that thusly, “Until Christ the ruler, seven weeks,”7
 which is
forty-nine years. For also in the twenty and first year Daniel
sees these things in Babylon. 30.6. And so when adding fortynine years to twenty-one years, they fulfill seventy years,
which the blessed prophet Jeremiah has spoken, that for
seventy years the Most Holy Place shall be desolate8
 from the
captivity which happened to them under Nebuchadnezzar

and after these things the people shall return and the sacrifices
and offerings of Christ their ruler shall be offered.
30.7. But of which Christ does he speak, except Jesus son
of Josedek, who returned together with the people at that
time, and in the seventieth year, after the Most Holy Place was
built, he offered a sacrifice according to the law?1
30.8. For all
kings and priests were called Christs on account of them
being anointed with holy oil, which Moses arranged long ago.
30.9. And so these carried the Lord's name2
 with themselves
predicting the future model and bringing to light the image,
until he who came from heaven, the perfect king and priest,
Christ, who alone does the will of the Father, as is written in
the book of kings, “And I shall raise up for myself a faithful
priest, who will do all according to my heart.”3
31.1. And so in order that the time when he is about to
come may be shown which the blessed Daniel desired to see,
he says, “And after seven weeks another sixty-two weeks,”4
which encompasses the time of four hundred and thirty-four
years. 31.2. For after the people returned from Babylon their
ruler Jesus son of Josedek and Ezra the scribe and Zerubbabel
the son of Shealtiel, who was from the tribe of Judah, four
hundred and thirty-four years occurred, until the advent of
Christ, so that the Priest of priests was shown in the world
and he who took away the sins of the world was clearly
demonstrated as John says concerning him, “Behold, the
Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.”5
31.3. Similarly Gabriel also says, “and to erase
unrighteousness and for sins to be atoned,”6
31.4. But who
erases our unrighteousness? Paul the apostle teaches you

saying, “He himself became our peace, who has made the two
one and who broke up the dividing wall, enmity in the flesh,
having abolished the law of commandments in the decrees of
the Law,”1
 and “having erased our sins which were written
against us, which were opposed to us, and taking it from our
midst, affixing it to the cross,”2
 and so “to erase
unrighteousness and for unrighteousness to be atoned.”3
31.5.
But who are they whose unrighteous are atoned except they
who believe in his name and through good works are these
atoned before his presence4
?
32.1. Because after the people returned from Babylon
four hundred and thirty and four years occurred until the
generation5
 of Christ, it is easy to perceive what has been set
before. 32.2. For since the first covenant with the sons of
Israel was given after four hundred and thirty-four years, it is
absolutely necessary for the second also likewise to be
determined in the same time, so that it may be expected by
the people and may be easily recognized by the believers.
32.3. And on account of this Gabriel says, “And to anoint
a Holy of Holies.”6
32.4. But no one is the Holy of Holies,
except the Son of God alone, who comes and shows himself
to be he who is anointed by the Father and was sent into the
world; he said to them, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
because he has anointed me, he sent me to evangelize the
poor, to heal the broken in heart, to preach freedom to the
captives and to restore sight to the blind, to preach an
acceptable year of the Lord.”7
32.5. And so as many as have
believed in the heavenly priest, these are cleansed by the same

priest, and their sins are wiped away1
. But as many as have
disbelieved him, as setting him up to be nothing but a simple
man, their sins are sealed as undiminished2
.
32.6. From which the angel, foreseeing that all were not
destined to believe in him, said, “to end sin and to seal sin.”3
32.7. For as many as disobeyed him until the end, their sins
were ended and were sealed to be kept for judgment. But as
many were destined to believe in him and confessed to him as
able to forgive sin, their sins were wiped away4
.
33.1. And on account of this he says, “And to seal vision
and prophecy5
.”6
33.2. For after the fullness of the law and
the prophets he himself has come, for the law and the
prophets were until John, it is necessary that the things which
were spoken by them be sealed, so that at the advent of the
Lord all things which have been loosed and all things which
have been sealed, may be brought to light, and what was not
able to be made known may easily be perceived, and that
which was bound long ago now may be loosed by him.
33.3. As the Lord himself has said to the chiefs of the
people, when they were angry at him when they saw him
commanding powers on the day of the Sabbath and healing
every disease and every sickness. But he said to them,
“Hypocrites, each of you, looses the ox and the donkey from
the stall and leads it away and gives it water. But this
daughter, who is of Abraham, whom Satan has bound ten
and eight years, is it not necessary for her to be loosed on the
day of the Sabbath?”7

33.4. And so as many as Satan has bound and ensnared,
when the Lord comes he shall loose them from the bonds of
death, having bound the strong man who was against us, and
having freed humanity. As Isaiah also says, “Then he will
speak to those in bonds, ‘Freedom’ and to those in darkness,
‘Be illuminated.’”1
33.5. But on account of all which was
spoken long ago through the law and the prophets, which has
been sealed and which was unknown to men, Isaiah says,
“And they will give the sealed book to a man skilled in letters
and they will say to him, ‘Read this,’ and he will say ‘I am not
able to read it, for it is sealed.’”2
33.6. For it is absolutely
necessary that what was spoken long ago through the
prophets to the unbelieving Pharisees, who pretended to
know the letters of law, that it was sealed, but to those who
believe all things, it was opened.
34.1. And so all which has been sealed long ago now
through the grace of the Lord, has been opened to the saints.
For he himself was a perfect seal and key which is from
David who opens and no one shuts, and shuts and no one
opens.
34.2. As also John says, “And I saw at the right hand of
him who sat upon the throne a book written inside and out,
which was sealed with seven seals. And I saw an angel
preaching in a great voice, ‘Who is worthy to open the book
and to loose its seals?’ And no one was able in heaven nor
upon the earth nor under the earth to open the book nor to
look at it. And many were weeping because no one was
found worthy to open the book nor to look at it. And the
one from the elders says to me, ‘Do not weep. Behold, the
lion from the tribe of Judah has conquered, the root and the
offspring of David, and he opens the book and looses its
seven seals.’ And I saw in the midst of the throne and in the

1

154
midst of the elders a lamb standing, who was slain, who had
seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of
God which are sent on to all the earth. And he came and he
took the book from the right hand of him who sat upon the
throne, and when he took the book, the four creatures and
the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, each having a
harp and golden bowls filled with incense, which are the
prayers of the saints, and they sang a new song saying, ‘You
are worthy to take the book and to open its seals because you
were slain and you purchased us for God by your blood from
every tribe and tongue and people and nation and you made a
kingdom and priests for God and they shall reign upon the
earth.’”1
34.3. And so he took the book and loosed it, so that what
was spoken long ago secretly concerning him, now may be
preached with boldness upon the rooftops. 34.4. And on
account of this the angel said to Daniel, “Seal these words
because the vision is of the end of time.” 2
 But they did not
say “Seal,” to Christ, but, “Loose what was bound long ago,”
so that through his grace we may recognize the will of the
Father and we may believe on that one whom he sent, Jesus
Christ our Lord, the Savior of men.3
35.1. Indeed it says, “and to return and a street and wall
shall be built.”4
 And it really happened. For the people
returned and built this city and temple and its wall in a circle.
35.2. Then he says, “after sixty-two weeks, times shall be
spun out5
 and he shall set forth a covenant with many for one
week. And in half of the week sacrifice and the drink

offering shall be taken away and upon the Temple shall be an
abomination of desolation.”1
35.3. For after sixty-two weeks was fulfilled and after
Christ has come2
 and the Gospel has been preached in every
place, times having been spun out, the end remains one week
away, in which Elijah and Enoch shall be present and in its
half the abomination of desolation, the Antichrist, shall
appear who threatens desolation of the world. After he
comes, sacrifice and drink offering, which now in every way is
offered by the nations to God, shall be taken away.3
Daniel’s final vision4
36.1. In this way, after speaking these things, the prophet
describes to us again another vision. For the blessed Daniel
meditated on no other vision, lest he not be accurately taught
all the things to come and he not teach and reveal these things to
us again. 36.2. Indeed he says, “In the third year of Cyrus
king of the Persians a word was revealed to Daniel, who was
called the name Baltasar, and the word was true and great
power and understanding was given to him in the vision. ‘In
those days, I, Daniel, was mourning5
 three weeks of days, I
did not eat desirable bread and meat and wine did not enter
my mouth and I did not anoint myself with oil for three full
weeks of days. On the twenty and fourth day of the first
month.’”6

36.3. “I was humbled1
,” he says, “twenty one days praying
to the living God requesting from him the revealing of
mysteries.”2
36.4. And then, after the Father heard, he sent
his Word, thus pointing out what is about to happen through
him and then that it would happen along the Great River. For
the event is necessary to have happened there where the Son3
 was
demonstrated, where also he was about to forgive sins.
4
36.5. “And I lifted,” he says, “my eyes and I saw, and
behold, one man clothed in linen.” And so in the first vision
he says, “Behold, the angel Gabriel came flying,”5
 Here
however he does not speak in this way, but he sees the Lord
himself, not yet perfectly man, but appearing in the shape of a
man just as he says, “And behold, one man clothed in linen.”6
linen.”6
36.6. For Christ being clothed with many cloaks of
mystery, points out the manifold calling of gifts.7
 Because the
the priestly cloak was equipped from different gifts in order
to indicate that many nations await the advent of Christ, so
that with many gifts we may be able to be equipped.8
37.1. “And his loins were girt in the gold of Ophaz.”9

Ophaz from the Hebrew indicates, having been translated
into Greek, “pure gold.” 37.2. And so purity was around his
loins like his belt. For the Word is about to bear all of us
around his own body with his own love, as a strong10 belt.

37.3. “And his body was like Tharsus.”2
 Tharsus is
interpreted as Ethiopian. For the prophet already proclaimed
its difficult interpretation3
, as the Word will be about to appear
in the flesh in the world, he will be hard to recognize for
many. 37.4. “And his face was like lightning and his eyes like
lamps of fire.”4
 For it is necessary for the fiery nature and the
the judgment of the Word to be foretold, so that fire, having
been righteously inflicted upon the impious, may consume
them, but to the righteous and to those who hope in him, he
offers deathless eternity.
37.5. He adds saying, “And his arms and feet were like
burnished bronze,”5
 so that the first calling of the fathers6
and second of the nations are indicated to be the same. For
the last will be as the first, for he says, “I will set your chiefs as
at the beginning and your rulers as the first.”7
37.6. “And his
voice was like the voice of a great crowd.”8
 For today all we
who believe in him utter the oracles of Christ as through his
mouth, speaking what is prescribed by him.
38.1. “And, I, Daniel alone saw the vision.”9
 For to the
saints and to those who fear him, to these only he reveals
himself. 38.2. For if one now expects this also to be

conducted in the church,1
 he has not the fear of God, and the
assembly of the saints helps him in nothing, having not
acquired the power of the Spirit in himself. 38.3. For also at
that time, there were many who were standing with Daniel,
but they did not see the vision for they were not worthy, but
great astonishment2
 fell upon them and they fled in fear.3
38.4. “And I,” he says, “was the only one left and I fell on
my face upon the earth, and behold, with the hand of a man
he touched me.”4
 He says, “the hand of a man,” not yet a
man, but indicating the coming of the economy through
grace.
39.1. “And he raised me from my knees and said to me,
‘Daniel cherished man, understand in the words which I
myself will speak to you and stand up in your place because
now I am sent to you.’ And when he spoke this word I stood
trembling and he said to me, ‘Do not be afraid Daniel
because from the first day which you gave your heart to
understand and to be afflicted before God, your words were
heard.’”5
39.2. Behold, how strong the piety of the righteous man,
so that the future things which have not yet been manifested
in this world6
, are revealed to the worthy alone. 39.3. First he
was made to understand by the angel Gabriel, then secondly,
by the Lord himself he was made wise.
39.4. For he spoke in this way, “And I saw, and behold,
as an appearance of a son of man he touched me.”7And so at

first he said, “as the hand of a man,”1
 but now he says, “as an
appearance of a son of man,” so that at first it was partially
shown to him, but secondly the whole human nature2
 was put
on and shown to him.
39.5. For the Word of God in the figure of a man is
proclaimed as a man and is displayed in the world as an
incarnate man, though not yet then being a son of man. But
when the fullness of time came, God sent his Son, born of a
woman, so that the Son of God may put on manhood3
 from
the Virgin and may be demonstrated as being the Son of God
and the Son of Man.
39.6. “And he opened,” he says, “my mouth and I spoke
to him who stood before me, ‘Lord in your appearance my
insides were turned within me and I have no strength,’”4
 for it
it is necessary that the advent of the Lord happened upon the
people above and below, so that those below may be able to
come to those above.5
39.7. “And he came close,” he says, “and he touched me
as an appearance of a man and he strengthened me and he
said to me, ‘Do not fear cherished man. Peace to you, be
strong like a man.’”6
 For when all the strength and glory of
our life is ended, then we are empowered by the outstretched
hand of Christ, who also raises us as the living from the dead
and as from Hades to the resurrection of life.
40.1. “And when he spoke with me I was strengthened
and I said, ‘Let my Lord speak because you have

strengthened me.’”1
40.2. For when the Word makes us hope
in the coming things, we are also easily able to hear his voice.
40.3. And so he says to him, “Do you know why I came
to you? And now I will return to fight with the chief of the
Persians, but I will proclaim to you what is written in the
Scripture of truth, and there is no one who endures with me
concerning these things except Michael your chief, and I left
him there, for from the day you gave your face to be afflicted
before your Lord God your petition was heard, and I myself
was sent to fight with the chief of the Persians. For some plot
happened to prevent me
2
 from coming to the people so that
therefore in haste your request may be answered, I myself
stood against him and I left Michael your chief there. 3

40.4. But who is Michael, but the angel who is granted to
the people, as he says to Moses, “I will not go with you on
the way because the people are stiff necked, but my angel will
go with you”?4
40.5. This one stood against Moses in the
encampment when he carried the uncircumcised boy5
 to
Egypt. For it was not possible for Moses to be the elder and
mediator of the law, who also announced the covenant of
the fathers, and also to lead the uncircumcised boy, so that he
may not be considered by the people as a false prophet and a
deceiver.
41.1. “And now,” he says, “I will proclaim to you the
truth.”6
 And so was the truth able to proclaim some other
thing beyond the truth? The truth was what was seen by
Daniel and he proclaimed the truth. He himself, with the

truth being revealed in the world, teaches the truth. On
account of1
 which the blessed disciples are taught by Christ.
41.2. And so he says to him, “Behold, still three kings
shall arise in Persia and the fourth will be rich with greater
riches than all. And after he himself masters his riches he
shall rise against all the kingdoms of the Greeks. And a
mighty king shall arise, and he shall be lord of a great
dominion and he shall do according to his will. And as his
kingdom rises it shall be shattered and divided to the four
winds of heaven.”2
41.3. And so we have already described these things
above when we made the account concerning the four beasts,
but since now Scripture describes all these things again in detail,
it is absolutely necessary also for us to make a second
account, so that we do not forsake Scripture as idle and
indemonstrable.
41.4. “Still three,” he says, “kings shall arise in Persia and
the fourth will be rich with greater riches than all.”3
 For after
Cyrus, Darius arose, then Artaxerxes, next Xerxes. These
three were kings. Scripture is fulfilled. 41.5. “And the fourth
will be rich with greater riches.”4
 Who is this but Darius,
who after reigning and being glorious, became wealthy and
rose against all the kingdoms of the Greeks?
41.6. Alexander of Macedon rose against him, who was
the son of Philip, and he seized his kingdom. And after he
subjected the Persians, his kingdom was divided to the four
winds of heaven. For while dying, Alexander divided his
kingdom to four chiefs.
42.1. “And another mighty king shall arise and he shall
enter into the strongholds of the king of Egypt.”5

one named Antiochus became king of Syria. 42.3. This one
reigned in the one hundredth and thirtieth and seventh year
of the kingdom of Greeks.
42.4. And at this point, then in those times he engaged in
war with Ptolemy king of Egypt, and having prevailed over
him he ruled. 42.5. This one, returning from Egypt, went up
to Jerusalem in the one hundredth and forty-third year and
taking all the treasures which were in the house of the Lord
he went to Antioch. 42.6. After these things happened in this
way, two years later the king sent his own tax collector to
compel the Jews in the cities of Judea to transgress the laws
of their fathers and to be subjected to the decrees and laws of
the king.
42.7. And at this point when he arrived in the city of
Modein, he summoned a certain righteous and pious man by
the name of Matthias, who was from priestly stock, to whom
he, answering, said, “Come now, Matthias, sacrifice and do
what is prescribed by the king, just as he made all nations,
because you are a great chief and a ruler in the city and are
established in children and you will be a friend of the king.”1
42.8. But he, answering, said, “Though all nations and
every man marches behind the king to do according to his
command, I myself and my house and the house of my father
will never do according to the prescription of the king; may
we never depart from the law and covenant of our fathers; we
will not listen to the words of the king to turn from our way
right or left!”2
42.9. While he was still speaking these words, behold, a
Jewish man, coming before his face, came to sacrifice upon
the altar of Modein. But Matthias, seeing him, was zealous for
the law and his innards trembled, and he stood up in the fury
of judgment and having fixed his mind to the task, he killed the
Jewish man and also overpowered the guard of the king, and

destroyed the altar and shouted, saying in the city, “Whoever
is for the Lord who maintains the holy covenant let him
follow after me!”1
42.10. And they left all their things in the city and fled into
the mountains and an assembly of strong men clung to him
with might and they became for him a support.
43.1. Then at this point, the army, which dwelt in Syria,
having heard what happened, ran against them and made war
against them on the day of the Sabbath. Those who feared
the law of God and who kept the commandment of God did
not lift up their hands against them, nor throw a stone against
them, nor devise hiding places. 43.2. And the soldiers2
answered them and said, “‘Come forth now and do the
command of the king and live!’ but they said, ‘We will not
come out, nor will we do the command of the king, we will
die in our sincerity. Heaven and earth testifies against you
because you kill us recklessly.’”3
43.3. Then they fell upon them in fire and murder and in
captivity and killed from them over a thousand souls. 43.4.
And so what was spoken to the blessed Daniel was fulfilled,
“And he will go on a journey and his heart shall be lifted up
against the holy covenant, and he shall want to do all
according to his heart, and my slaves shall be persecuted and
weakened in hunger and in sword and in captivity.”4
44.1. But after he heard these things, Matthias and his sons
lamented concerning their brothers and they spoke to one
another, saying, “If we all should do just as our brothers did,
our enemies shall come and quickly remove us from the
earth. And so if war comes upon us on the Sabbath let us

stand and make war on behalf of our souls and on behalf of
our customs.”1
44.2. Then after that point they ran down upon them and
they pursued them from their boundaries and they entered
into the city and circumcised the young boys, as many as they
found uncircumcised, and they threw down the altars and all
the sacred places and the deed brought prosperity into their
hand.2
44.3. But Daniel says, “they shall be held with little
help.”3
44.4. For then, after Matthias arose, Judas the
Maccabee arose and helped them and delivered them from
the hand of the Greeks and what was spoken in Scripture was
fulfilled.
45.1. Again he says, “And the daughter of the king of the
South will come to the king of the North to make with him
agreements and the arms of him who brings4
 her shall not
stand and he5
 shall be crushed and both she and he who brings
her shall fall.”6
45.2. And this also happened. For a certain7
Ptolemy, who reigned at this point in Egypt, went out with
her two sons Ptolemy and Philometer, making agreements
with Antiochus the king of Syria. And then she, having come
to Scythopolis, was killed there, for he who led her betrayed
her. Then at this point the two brothers engaged in war with
one another and Philometer was killed, but Ptolemy ruled.
45.3. Accordingly, a meeting between Ptolemy and
Antiochus happened again. For Scripture says thusly, “And
the king of the south rose up against the king of the north
and he rose up seed from her.”8
45.4. But what kind of seed
except Ptolemy, who joined war with Antiochus? 45.5. At this

Antiochus marched out and did not overpower him, being set
to flight, he turned again to Antioch gathering a greater
crowd.
45.6. Accordingly, Ptolemy took all the military
equipment and brought it into Egypt. And the Scripture was
fulfilled just as Daniel says, “And indeed he shall carry into
Egypt their gods and their things formed from cast metal and
every desirable golden vessel.”1
46.1. After these things Antiochus came out a second time
raising war against him and he overcame Ptolemy. 46.2. And
then, after these things happened, Antiochus again stirred up
the sons of Israel and he dispatched a certain Nicanor with a
great army in order to make war against the Jews, while Judas,
after the death of his father Matthias, ruled the people.
46.3. And so Nicanor, coming to Jerusalem, was defeated
by the Maccabee and he reported these things to king
Antiochus. But he, having heard this, summoned all his
armies and gave to them allowances2
 for one year and he
commanded them to be ready for what was necessary. 46.4. At
this point, having failed to fulfill the salaries, he wished to
enter into Persia in order to take tributes.
46.5. Accordingly, as he was about to depart, he
addressed his friend3
, Lysias by name, and he set before him
his own son Antiochus, and he commanded him to do all the
things he willed, and he commanded him to send an army into
Judea and to destroy the nation. 46.6. Accordingly, Lysias,
having arisen with the boy Antiochus, went with a great army,
to wage war against Jerusalem.
46.7. And he came and was defeated by the Maccabee and
these things were reported in Persia to Antiochus, that all the
armies which were sent into Judea were cut down and that

Lysias went with an army against them and was overthrown
from their faces, and also that the Jews1
 were strong in arms
and were strong in every neighborhood and from every camp
which he was cut down and that they fortified Mount Zion
and that they had built a great and high wall around the city2
.
46.8. But Antiochus3
, having heard this, fell into sickness
from grief because just as he did not will, it also happened,
and just as he did not want, thus it also occurred. 46.9. And
then being about to die, he called Philip his friend and he
gave to him the diadem in order that he might restore it to his
child Antiochus. 46.10. When Philip4
 arrived he entered
Antioch and he kept himself safe in the palace. For the
greatest armies were with him.
46.11. And so these things were reported to Lysias and the
child Antiochus, for it happened that Lysias had raised a
barricade against Jerusalem to besiege it because Philip had
arrived carrying the diadem and because he ruled Antioch5
.
46.12. But having heard this, he was troubled and said,
“Let us give pledges to these men and let us have peace with
them. For the place is strong and it is closed to us and to the
armies of the kingdom.”6
46.13. And having given pledges, he
departed and what was spoken in Scripture was fulfilled,
“And rumors and engagements troubled him from the east
and west.”7
47.1. After these things happened Scripture says again,
“And another king shall arise8
 and he shall prevail over the

earth and the king of the south shall arise1
 and he shall take
his daughters to wife.”2
47.2. For it happened that a certain
Alexander, the son of Philip arose. And in that time he rose
up against Antiochus and, having made war with him, he
killed him, and he ruled the kingdom.
47.3. Then he sent to Ptolemy king of Egypt, saying,
“Give to me your daughter Cleopatra to wife. For behold, I
sit upon the throne of the kingdom of my fathers.”3
47.4.
And then Ptolemy took his daughter and brought her into
Ptolmaeus and gave her to Alexander to wife. And Scripture
was fulfilled as it says, “and he shall take his daughters to
wife.”4
47.5. But it says, “And he shall corrupt her, she shall not
be for him5
.” And truly this was fulfilled. For when Ptolemy
gave him his own daughter, he turned and saw the wondrous
and glorious kingdom of Alexander, of which he was very
eager to have, so he spoke deceitfully to Alexander.
47.6. But Scripture says, “And the kings shall speak lies to
one another at one table.”6
 For Ptolemy desired the kingdom
kingdom of Alexander and ate with him at his table, but he
thought evil and did not have agreement with him. And so
Scripture was fulfilled. 47.7. And at this point Ptolemy,
having come to Egypt and having levied a great army, came
to the country when Alexander had gone to Cilicia. For it
happened at that time that Tarsus and Mallus7
 were thrown
into confusion. He wished to repress them and came against
them in haste, having left his own wife Cleopatra there.
47.8. Accordingly, Ptolemy went up to the country and
mustered a watch guard against the city. Having conquered

Judea, he came to his own daughter and sent a letter to
Demetrius in the islands saying, “Come out and come here
and I will give to you my daughter Cleopatra to wife because
Alexander sought to kill me.”1
 But he pretended these words
wishing to lay blame upon Alexander.
47.9. Accordingly, Demetrius came and Ptolemy received
him and gave his daughter to wife, who was the wife of
Alexander. And what was spoken was fulfilled, “He shall
corrupt her and she shall not be to him nor remain with
him,”2
 because “The kings, their hearts set on evil, even
spoke lies to one another at one table.”3
47.10. In this way after these things happened, Alexander,
having heard this, engaged in war with Ptolemy, and having
not overpowered him, became a fugitive to the king of the
Arabs. But he, removing the head of Alexander, sent it to
Ptolemy and that one received it and the two diadems of Syria
and Egypt were bestowed on him, which after being bestowed
he died on the third day. And what was spoken in Scripture
was fulfilled, “And they did not give to him the glory of
kingdom.”4
 For he died and he did not receive glory from
anyone as king.
48.1. And so the prophet, having described what has
already occurred and has been accomplished in its own time,
he proclaims another mystery to us, making an indication of
the end of times.
48.2. For he speaks in this way, “And another shameless
king shall arise and he shall be exalted over every god and
shall be magnified and he shall say immoderate things and he
shall prosper until the wrath is consummated. For it is to be
consummated. And he shall not regard any god of his fathers

nor desire women and he shall not regard any god, because
he shall be magnified over all. And he shall glorify the god of
Moazeim in his place and a god which his fathers did not
know; he shall honor in gold and silver and precious stones
and he shall multiply glory and shall subject many to them
and divide the earth in gifts. And these shall be preserved
from his hand, Edom and Moab and the chief of the sons of
Ammon. And he shall stretch forth his hand upon the earth
and the land of Egypt shall not be saved and he shall rule
over the secret things of gold and silver and of all the desirable
things of Egypt and Libya and Ethiopia in their fortresses.
And he shall pitch his tent1
 Efadano2
 between the seas near
the holy Mountain of Sabir3
 and he shall come to his lot.”4
49.1. And so these things the prophet described in this way
concerning the Antichrist, as he will be shameless and warlike
and a tyrant daring to exalt himself over every god, who
boasts in his own power and pillages the fortresses of cities,
and bearing lofty things in gold and silver and precious stone,
he shall speak immoderate words against God, wishing that
he himself alone be worshiped as God.
49.2. Concerning him all Scripture is not silent and the
prophets announced beforehand his coming for the
destruction of many, and the Lord has testified to these things,
and the apostles taught these things concerning him, and John
in the Apocalypse mystically revealed his name through a
number. 49.3. The Lord displayed this abomination of
desolation and the apostle taught that this son of the devil
arrives according to the working of Satan.
49.4. This one, having struck the city of Tyre, will also
desolate the land of Egypt, having waged war he will extend5

and destroy all the land of Libya, and he shall ruin the
kingdom of the Ethiopians with his might in the slaughter of
the sword. 49.5. He, being lifted up over every king and every
god, shall build the city of Jerusalem and he shall raise the
converted1
 Temple, he shall restore both all the land and its
borders to the Jews, and having summoned their people from
the slavery of the nations, he shall exhibit himself to them as
king, and at this the faithless2
 shall worship him as God and
shall bend the knee to him, considering him to be the Christ,
not apprehending what was spoken by the prophet, how he is
a deceiver and not truth.
49.6. For Jeremiah says, “Instead they disobeyed the
truth, then a spirit shall deceptively speak to this people and
to Jerusalem.”3
 49.7. From which the apostle, when he saw a
deceiver of the people, who will also be the work of Satan in
them, said, “Whenever they say ‘Peace,’ and ‘Security,’ then
suddenly ruin shall come upon them, just as the pain of
birthing, and they shall not escape.”4
50.1. This one will kill the two witnesses and precursors
of Christ who herald his glorious advent from heaven, as he
says through the prophet, “And I will give power to my two
witnesses and they shall prophesy one thousand two hundred
sixty days wearing sack cloth.”5
50.2. Just as also he spoke to Daniel, “And he shall
establish a covenant with many for one week and it will be
that in the half of the week he shall take away my sacrifice and
drink offering,”6
 so that the one week may be shown as
divided into two, after the two witnesses will have preached

for three and a half years, the Antichrist will wage war against
the saints the remainder of the week and will desolate all the
world so that what was spoken may be fulfilled, “And they
will give the abomination of desolation one thousand two
hundred ninety days. Blessed is he who endures to Christ
and reaches the one thousand three hundred thirty-five
days!”1
50.3. For then there will be a great persecution like which
there has not been such from the foundation of the world,
while others from here and there are sent against every city
and land in order to kill those who believe, and the Jews
cheer at their destruction, and the nations rejoice and the
unfaithful celebrate2
 with them, but the saints, coming from
the west to the east and others from the east to the south3
 are
pursued, but others will hide in the mountains and in caverns,
everywhere the abomination will make war against them even
through the sea and through dry places. He will kill them
through the command and according to every way he will
oppress them from the earth and not allow them to sell some
of their own possessions nor to buy from another's things, unless
one should carry on his hand the name of the beast, or one
should bear his mark upon his forehead.
50.4. For then all the faithful will be banished from every
place and will be displaced from their homes and will be
expelled from their cities and will be swept away by the state4
and they will be punished with every punishment and will be
cast out from all the world.
51.1. And so it is needful to consider the coming
persecution of the saints at that time5
 and the distress, for it is
is necessary for us, from what has partially occurred already,

to reflect on the future things, that such distress and upheaval
in all the world will occur, and everywhere all the faithful will
be killed and slaughtered in every city and land, and the blood
of the righteous will be poured out and men will be burned
alive and others shall be thrown to beasts, and infants in the
womb shall be murdered, and all shall be hurled away
unburied, and shall be eaten by dogs, both virgins and women
shall be corrupted in openness and shall be shamefully
mocked, and be captured and they shall dig up the graves of
saints and destroy the remains and they shall hurl them onto a
plain, and they shall become blasphemous.
51.2. Then there shall be upheaval in the cities, when the
saints are persecuted from there. There will be upheaval in
roads and in deserts when all wish to be hidden there. There
will be upheaval in the sea when all attempt to flee through
water. There will be upheaval on the islands when all seek to
go there. 51.3. And then the earth will be barren for the saints
and every city uninhabitable and the sea unnavigable and all
the world a desert, when they are destroyed by famine, and
faint from thirst, but others die from fear and from the great
persecution.
51.4. But then how will a man hide? To whom shall his
own children run? How, after his belongings have been
carried off, shall he preserve them, when he is not able to save
his own soul? 51.5. Then there will be many wailings of
infants, lamentations of both fathers and mothers, loud
cryings of both wives and virgins, moans of both brothers
and cousins. 51.6. Then will one mourn another? Brother will
not mourn brother, for he also expects death. Mother will not
mourn daughter, for she also suspects death. Father will not
mourn son, fearing that he also will be killed.
52.1. On account of this, the Lord, foreseeing these things,
says, “Pray that your flight does not happen in winter or on
the Sabbath, you ought not to rest from righteousness nor
engage in the matters of this life, as in winter, lest that day

unknowingly fall upon you as a trap.”1
52.2. “For if,” he says,
“those days were not curtailed, not any flesh would be saved.
But on account of the elect those days will be curtailed.”2
52.3. “But after the persecution of those days, the sun
shall be darkened and the moon shall not give its splendor
and the stars shall burn out and fall from heaven and the
powers of heaven shall be shaken and then they shall see the
Son of Man coming with power and great glory.”3
52.4. For if the devil receives for a little while authority to
trouble the earth, as it is written, “God has given to him the
authority to test those who dwell upon the earth,”4
 how much
more rather that the Son of God, when he takes all authority
of heavenly and earthly and subterranean things, shall trouble
all the earth and the elements in it, arriving to avenge the
saints with angelic power and patriarchal glory, when he
comes to be glorified in his saints and to be marveled by all
who pray to him and to repay those who persecuted us with
persecution, but to repay us who were persecuted with rest.
53.1. And so Daniel has foretold two abominations, one of
destruction, one of desolation. What is the one of destruction
but what was set up there in the time of Antiochus? And
what was the one of desolation but the universal5
abomination
when the Antichrist is near? 53.2. As Daniel says, “And he
himself shall stand for the destruction of many and he shall
divide the earth in gifts and he shall cast an embankment
against her6
 and the land of Egypt shall not be saved7
, and

these shall be saved from his hand, Edom and Moab and the
chief of the sons of Ammon.”1
53.3. For these are partners with him on account of
kinship2
 who also first proclaimed him king. For Edom is the
sons of Esau who dwell at Mount Seir. But Moab and
Ammon are the sons of Lot, who were begotten from his two
daughters. As also Isaiah says, “And they shall be dispersed
in ships of foreigners, carrying them together to the sea and
those from the East and the West and from the North shall
give glory, but the sons of Ammon first shall obey.”
3
54.1. This one being proclaimed by them as king and
being glorified by them and becoming the abomination of
desolation to the world, he shall rule one thousand two
hundred ninety days. As Daniel also says, “And they will give
the abomination of desolation one thousand two hundred
ninety days. Blessed is he who endures and reaches the one
thousand three hundred thirty-five days.”4
54.2. For when the abomination is present and wages war
against the saints, whenever his days have passed, and it
draws near to the forty-five other days which approach the
fiftieth day, it reaches to the kingdom of heavens. 54.3. For
the Antichrist comes to the portion on the fiftieth day as
about to inherit the kingdom together with Christ.
54.4. And on account of this Isaiah says, “Let the impious
be killed, so that he may not see the glory of the Lord.”5
54.5.
54.5. And Paul says to the Thessalonians, “Whom the Lord
Jesus shall kill with the spirit of his mouth and shall abolish
him with the manifestation of his advent,”6
 but the saints are
destined to inherit the kingdom with Christ.

55.1. And so of the things which will be in this way he
adds saying, “And many of they who sleep in the dust of the
earth shall arise, some to eternal life and some to reproach
and eternal shame and they who understand shall shine as the
splendor of the firmament and the many righteous as the
stars in the age to come1
.”2
55.2. And so who are they who sleep in the dust of the
earth, but the bodies of men who receive their own souls to
be raised, who are of the resurrection of life, who are pure and
radiant and shine as splendor of the firmament, who receive
these things. But they who have the resurrection of judgment,
sufficient in themselves for eternal punishment, receive these
things, just as Paul says, “But he himself shall be saved as
through fire.”3
55.3. For also the Lord in the Gospel spoke the same,
“Then the righteous shall gleam as the sun shines in its
glory.”4
55.4. And Isaiah says, “Rise sleeper, and wake from
the dead and Christ shall shine on you.”5
55.5. And the Lord
again, “Truly I say to you, an hour comes and now is when
the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and those
who practice good shall rise to the resurrection of life, but
those who practice evil to the resurrection of judgment.”6
55.6. These, he says, shall be resurrected to life, they who
really have believed in life and who are written in the Book of
Life. And they to eternal reproach and shame, who partnered
with the Antichrist, and with him are cast into eternal
punishment.
55.7. Concerning whom Isaiah prophesies saying, “In
which manner a garment which has been defiled in blood will

not be pure, thus you will not be pure, because you have
desolated my earth and have killed my people. The evil seed
shall never remain forever. Prepare your children for the
slaughter for the sins of your fathers, that they may not raise
up and inherit my land.”1
56.1. After these things were spoken in this way, Daniel
says, “And I saw, and behold, two other men were standing,
one on the side of the bank of the river and one on the other
side of the bank of the river and they answered to the man
who stood above the water of the river and they said to him,
‘When will be the end of the wondrous words which you
have spoken?’ And I heard the man who was clothed in linen,
who was above the water of the river and he raised his right
and his left hand to heaven and swore by him who lives for
ever that in time and times and half of the time, when the
dispersion is consummated, they will know all these things.”2
56.2. And so who were the two men who were standing
alongside the bank of the river except the law and the
prophets? 56.3. And who was the one who stood above the
water except he himself3
, concerning whom they themselves
heralded long ago, who was destined to be visibly testified by
the Father at the Jordan in the end and to be shown to the
people in openness by John, who carries the ink of a scribe
and linen around his loins and being dressed with a
multicolored tunic.4
56.4. These, seeing him, learned that to him was given all
rule and authority, so that they understood exactly concerning
him, when he is about to bring judgment to the world and
when what was spoken by him shall be fulfilled. 56.5. But he,
wishing to persuade these according to every way, raised his

right hand and his left hand to heaven and swore by him who
lives forever.
56.6. What and to whom did he swear? The Son swore to
Father, saying that the Father lives forever and that they truly
shall know all these things in a time and times and half of a
time, when the dispersal of the Jews has been consummated.
56.7. And so he stretched out his hands, and through this he
displayed the passion.
56.8. But when he says, “In a time and times and half of
the time,”1
 he signaled that the things of the Antichrist are for
three-and-a-half years. For he says a time is one year, but
times are two years, and half of a time is half of one year.
These are the one thousand two hundred ninety days which
Daniel foretold.
57.1. And so, after the dispersion of the Jews happens, the
suffering of the people2
 is consummated, in those days the
Antichrist is near, then they shall know all these things. 57.2.
And so, O man, why do you still doubt at what was spoken,
or how do you not believe what was spoken by the Lord,
when his first advent has already occurred, and he who stood
upon the water at that time and was seen by Daniel in the
world, now is made famous and his passion is declared to all,
and the dispersion has happened to the people of the Jews by
the Romans?
57.3. For when he says, “When the dispersion of the Jews is
consummated they shall know all these things,”3
 then, when
the Lord came to them and was not recognized by them, they
were scattered into all the world, becoming exiles from their
own land. And being attacked by enemies, they were banished
from the city of Jerusalem, becoming a joy to all nations, so
that the Gospel of the Lord may be preached in all the world

and all time may be fulfilled and the end of the week may be
encompassed and the two precursors of Christ may be
dispatched and the abomination of desolation may be shown
with them and the Judge of judges may be revealed from
heaven and the resurrection of the saints and of all the world
may occur and the eternal kingdom may be given to the saints
and the unquenchable and sleepless fire of the impious may
be inflamed.
58.1. After these things were spoken in this way, the
prophet, wishing to more precisely investigate what would be
the kind of things which would happen after the resurrection, he
answered him and said, “‘Lord what will be the end of these?’
And he said, ‘Come Daniel. because these words are closed
and sealed until the end of time, until many are chosen and
are made white and are tried with fire and the lawless shall be
lawless and the wise shall understand and you, come and rest.
For there are still many days to the fulfillment of the
consummation and to the resurrection, to your inheritance at
the consummation of days.’”1
58.2. For since what God prepared for the saints a man is
now not able to describe, for neither his eye sees, nor his ear
hears, nor the heart of a man ascends to it, for which even the
angels desire to glimpse, he spoke in this way to him, “These
words are sealed until the end of time until many are chosen
and are made white and are tried with fire.”2

58.3. But who are the chosen, but they who are found
worthy of the kingdom? 58.4. And who is whitened, but they
who believe the word of truth so that they are whitened
through it and casting off the filth of sins they are clothed
with purity from heaven and the radiant Holy Spirit, so that

when the cloud1
 is present they may immediately enter with
him? 58.5. And who are they who are tried with fire except
they who pass through fire and water through the washing of
rebirth of the Spirit and do the will of the Father through
many fiery trials and afflictions. 58.6. “And the lawless shall
be lawless and the wise shall understand.”2
 They who are
lawless are that way through their own choice and the wise
again, through their own choice, are satisfied.
59.1. And so, when the Lord described this to the disciples
concerning the coming kingdom of the saints, that it will be
glorious and wonderful, Judas was astounded at the words
and said, “And who will then see these things?” But the Lord
said, “Those who are worthy will see these things.”3
59.2. Now behold, O man, what was sealed long ago and
was not able to be known in openness, is now preached on
the rooftops and the Book of Life, which has already clearly
been opened4
, opens wide5
 on the wood of the cross, having an
inscription written in Latin and Greek and Hebrew, that also
the Romans and Greeks and Hebrews may be taught, so that

 This is likely taken from an account written by Papias, possibly via
Irenaeus:
“These things Papias, the hearer of John, who was a
companion of Polycarp, a man of ancient time, testifies in writing in the
fourth of his books, for there are five books composed by him. And he
adds saying “These things are believable to those who believe. For,”
he says, “even Judas the betrayer who did not believe and questioned
‘And how will such things happen been accomplished by God?’ But the
Lord said ‘those who come to those times shall see.’” ~Irenaeus
