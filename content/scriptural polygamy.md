Jacob 2 teaches that a man must have only 1 wife in verse 27, then in verse 30 it teaches that if God will "raise up seed" unto himself, he will command his people. Otherwise they shall have 1 wife and 1 husband. 

In Doctrine and Covenants 132 it teaches that 

Jacob 2
27 Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord: For there shall not any man among you have save it be one wife; and concubines he shall have none;

30 For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things.
